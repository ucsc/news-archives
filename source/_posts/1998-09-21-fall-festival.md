The Fire Department's new fire engine is but one highlight of the annual OPERS fall festival, taking place Tuesday, September 29.

The festival is free and open to UCSC students, faculty, and staff. It offers information tables where participants can find out about UCSC's sports teams, physical education classes, and intramural and recreational programs, student organizations, and student services, or get facts on parking or shuttle service. The boating program will show off its kayaks. Jugglers will juggle and martial arts practitioners will demonstrate their skills.

"It's a great way for students to pick up some information and relax before the year begins," said Karol Fabrizio, head of the Recreation Program. She estimates that 2,500 to 3,500 people attend the event each year.

The festival will take place between 3:30 and 6:30 p.m. on the East Field. A barbecue dinner starts at 4 p.m. and is free to students with meal plans, $6.50 to students, faculty, and staff without.

Live music will be provided by Kosono, billed as an "African highlife" band.

The festival is sponsored by OPERS, UCSC's colleges, and Student Organization Advising and Resources (SOAR).
