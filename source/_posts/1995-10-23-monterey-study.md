title: $562,500 Grant Launches Student Training In Monterey Bay Regional Studies At UC Santa Cruz

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Studies of the host of environmental issues facing  the Monterey Bay area, from the health of the bay's fisheries to the  restoration of unique habitats at Fort Ord, have received a  substantial boost: a $562,500 grant from the National Science  Foundation (NSF) to train graduate students at the University of  California, Santa Cruz.

The funds will be offered to students through the Monterey Bay  Regional Studies (MBRS) program, created last year at UC Santa Cruz.  MBRS unites natural scientists and social scientists at UCSC and  other institutions in the region to study coastal and ecological  issues that are too broad for any one discipline.

Over the five-year duration of the NSF grant, twelve graduate  students will receive funding to cover tuition and expenses for about  half (2.5 years) of the time required to earn their doctoral degrees.  The students will pursue the usual requirements for a Ph.D. in fields  such as biology, environmental studies, or marine sciences. In  addition, each student will work with MBRS researchers outside of  their specialties in order to learn how to view research challenges  through a different lens.

"Environmental systems are no longer pristine," says Laurel  Fox, professor of biology at UCSC and director of MBRS. "Human  impacts have become an integral part of the biological world. But  these interactions are rarely considered in research projects or in  the training of students. MBRS provides a way for faculty and  students to break out of their traditional disciplinary roles."

Chancellor Karl S. Pister of UCSC will augment the NSF grant  with additional funds to support the MBRS program. The Division of  Graduate Studies also will contribute funds to pay for visiting  speakers, help students attend meetings, and recruit new graduate  students into the program.

Fox and her colleagues at MBRS--most notably grant codirector  Margaret FitzSimmons, an associate professor of environmental  studies--won the grant in an NSF-wide competition. Reviewers of  the proposal noted the research strengths of the UCSC faculty  involved with MBRS, as well as the "innovative" collaborations that  students would experience.

"This is an exciting attempt to combine training in  naturalsciences and social sciences by focusing on environmental  problems and issues that arise in the nearby region," one reviewer  commented. Another concluded: "The impact of this program both  locally and as a national model should be considerable."

Students supported through the grant will take special classes  and seminars that emphasize interdisciplinary research tools. Each  student will complete an apprenticeship under the supervision of a  researcher in a different field. For instance, a student studying soil  nutrients might work with a sociologist who examines the lives of  migrant farm workers; a Ph.D. candidate in the biology of nearshore  fishes could explore thehistory of Monterey Bay fisheries with an  economist.

Several off-campus agencies have agreed to support students  in such apprenticeships. They include the Elkhorn Slough National  Estuarine Reserve, the National Biological Survey, the National  Marine Fisheries Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the  Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments.

"The kinds of new researchers needed today must have deep  expertise with a discipline, but must also be able to appreciate and  make use of other approaches as needed," says Fox. "Training such  researchers is the goal of this program."

About twenty faculty members at UCSC are active participants  in MBRS. In addition to the new graduate training initiative, the  program features regular seminars where the group discusses  regional issues, an annual course for interested graduate students  and advanced undergraduates, and public symposia to draw together  researchers from the region's many scientific institutions. The next  symposium is likely to occur in the spring of 1996 at Fort Ord.

In addition, MBRS researchers are seeking funding for three  "demonstration projects" to test and refine the interdisciplinary  approach to studying natural systems and their human influences.  Current plans for the demonstration projects include the following:

* A study of protected rock fisheries along the coast from  Monterey through Big Sur to examine the ecological, economical, and  political effects of fishing bans in the region.

* An examination of maritime chaparral habitats at Fort Ord,  including the basic biology of the chaparral's plants and animals, the  use of fire as a way to manage the land, and how the ocean's  influence on the ecosystem changes with distance from the coast.

* Analysis of past and present relationships between  agriculture and the environment at Elkhorn Slough, in collaboration  with several well-established studies of the region.
