## Public Symposium On 'the Ecologies Of The Coast' At UCSC April 11

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The public is invited to attend a free symposium on "The Ecologies of the Coast," featuring experts on coastal issues and interactions affecting the Monterey Bay region. The symposium will be held Sunday, April 11, from 1 to 5 p.m., in Oakes College Room 105 on the UC Santa Cruz campus.

The interface between land and sea is a dynamic and integrated setting, where biological, geological, social, and economic processes interact. The symposium, sponsored by UCSC's Monterey Bay Regional Studies program, will bring together a multidisciplinary array of speakers to address these interactions and the policy implications for the Monterey Bay region.

The speakers will include Michael Orbach, a professor of marine affairs and policy at Duke University, who is visiting UCSC as a Regents' Lecturer. Orbach is director of the Marine Laboratory at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment. He will provide an overview on the ecologies of the coast.

Christopher Carr, an attorney with the environmental law firm Beveridge and Diamond in Sacramento, will address legal and policy issues affecting the coast. Mark Carr, assistant professor of biology at UCSC, will discuss Marine Protected Areas. Chris Dewees, marine fisheries specialist with the UC Sea Grant Program and UC Davis, will speak on fishing communities and fishery governance structure. Gary Griggs, director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, will discuss coastal geology. And Carol Shennan, director of UCSC's Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, will discuss agroecology and wetlands.
