![][1] Nine of the 17 UCSC faculty who contributed to the recently released book _The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History_ took a moment to pose for the camera during a reception at University House celebrating both Women's History Month and the release of the landmark book, which portrays the experience of women in the United States from precolonial times to the present.

The five-member team that edited the book included Gloria Steinem and UCSC professor of politics Gwendolyn Mink. The UCSC contributors pictured are, left to right: Lisbeth Haas, Barbara Bair, Carla Freccero, Aida Hurtado, Marilyn Westerkamp, Marge Frantz, Mink, Dana Frank, and Alice Yang Murray.
