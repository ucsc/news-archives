SANTA CRUZ, CA--When Japan's powerhouse "bubble economy" of the late  1980s burst on the last day of 1989, it signaled the end of phenomenal  growth and more than two decades of rapid overseas business expansion. The  remarkable combination had provoked discussion among economists, who have  continued to watch the country's subsequent reforms nearly as closely as the  policies that contributed to impressive growth.

One of those who has tracked the roller-coaster ride of Japan's modern  economy is Michael M. Hutchison, a professor of economics at the University  of California, Santa Cruz. Hutchison is coauthor of a new book, The Political  Economy of Japanese Monetary Policy (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1997),  which provides a detailed analysis of what went right, what went wrong, and  where Japan is headed now.

"During the 1980s, a lot of credit for Japan's success was aimed at  their management techniques, their educational system, their trade policies- -even the harmony of their traditional culture," said Hutchison. "What we've  tried to do is look at their successes and failures within the context of  Japan's financial and monetary systems."

The book covers the history of the modern Japanese economy from about  1975 to the present; monetary and exchange-rate policies; the banking crisis  that began in 1990 and continues today; and Japan's political economy--the  politics of business cycles, oversight of its central bank, and reforms  adopted in the wake of the downturn.

"Basically, Japan went from an economy that was enjoying above peak- level growth in the last half of the 1980s, with soaring real estate and stock  prices and major overseas expansion of banking operations, to a 60 percent  decline of asset prices within about two years," said Hutchison. "It's a decline  that rivals the Great Depression, and they've been working through it ever  since."

The book describes the impact of the "bandwagon effect" on the bubble  economy. "We call it a bubble economy because it wasn't supported by the  fundamentals," said Hutchison. "Investors were buying up stocks at inflated  prices not because they expected a solid dividend return but because they  expected further gains in the value," said Hutchison. "Real estate prices were  so out of line that at one time the land beneath the Emperor's Palace in Tokyo  was considered more valuable than all of California."

Although the collapse was anticipated by many economic observers,  experts had been intrigued for years by another compelling aspect of the  economy's performance: From 1975 to 1994, Japan enjoyed an inflation rate  of only 2 percent--the lowest in the industrialized world. "We had to ask  ourselves how Japan was able to deliver this," recalled Hutchison. "Clearly,  you didn't need high inflation to have high growth. Japan had the best of both  worlds."

Hutchison and his coauthors Thomas F. Cargill, a professor of economics  at the University of Nevada at Reno, and Takatoshi Ito, professor of  economics at the Institute of Economic Research at Hitotsubashi University,  credit Japan's central bank with adopting conservative policies after the  1973 oil crisis sent inflation soaring to 20 percent. "It's not that Japan had a  particularly independent central bank from a legal perspective," said  Hutchison. "Rather, they had a very tough-minded bureaucracy that resisted  party politics."

In the wake of the banking crisis, political pressure focused on the  Ministry of Finance, which ironically sought to deflect charges of  incompetence by offering up the central bank for reform. "There was no  problem with the central bank," noted Hutchison. "But the Ministry of Finance  granted the bank more independence at a time when most countries suffering  from very high inflation were seeking to give their central banks more  autonomy from the whims of politicians."

If anything, the Ministry of Finance itself suffered from a tendency to  micromanage the terms of financial regulations while operating under a set  of unwritten rules that favored personal relationships, said Hutchison.

Hutchison and his coauthors devote two chapters to Japanese exchange- rate policy, which is Hutchison's specialty. Although the value of the yen has  fluctuated over the past 25 years, Japan has for the most part enjoyed long- term appreciation of its currency--another important factor that helped gird  the country's economy, said Hutchison. "We give a lot of credit to the  monetary policy side of things," he noted. "It has been quite well run."

By contrast, Japan's financial system has not fared so well, and Tokyo  is scrambling to gain ground with the international financial powerhouses of  London, New York, and Singapore. "Japan's system of limited foreign access,  unwritten regulations, and discretionary decision making has not allowed it  to keep up with the demands of the world economy. Even Japanese  corporations go abroad for financing now," said Hutchison. "Japan is having to  run as fast as it can to modernize and update its policies, and it remains to  be seen whether it is flexible enough to adapt to modern realities."

Hutchison and his coauthors have already signed a contract with MIT  Press to publish a follow-up book that examines Japan's push to modernize  its financial system.
