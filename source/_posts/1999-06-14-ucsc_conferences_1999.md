## Conference Season Keeps UC Santa Cruz Busy During Summer Months

SANTA CRUZ, CA-Some 10,000 visitors from 30 different countries are expected to come to the University of California, Santa Cruz, this summer to participate in nearly 60 camps, conferences, institutes, and outreach programs.

The ten-week conference season lasts from June 20 to August 28 this year. Its diverse offerings range from a conference focused on the origins of the universe to youth camps for academics or sports.

The conference program generates roughly $3 million annually for UCSC. Conference guests purchase food and services from the campus and occupy the 2,400 beds at UCSC's eight residential colleges. Income from the summer season helps to offset room-and-board rates charged to UCSC students by about $200 each year. Income is also returned to UCSC's colleges to help support student programs.

Approximately 60 percent of summer bookings come from UCSC Extension, Summer Session, and academic programs sponsored by faculty and staff. Sports teams, businesses, youth groups, and government and professional organizations make up the remaining 40 percent. For information about this summer's conferences or about services offered by the Conference Office, call (831) 459-2611 or go to [www.ucsc.edu/conference][2]. This year's conferences include:

For their studies, participants choose from subjects ranging from engineering design to neurobiology or psychology. The program at UCSC is one of six such summer residential programs sponsored by the Center for Academic Achievement in the U.S. [www.jhu.edu/gifted][3]

\--Avance (July 2-31). This intensive four-week residential program enhances academic achievement for students from migrant families who are overage for their grade in school.

SOFIA-Star Formation Workshop (July 12-17). NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and the German space agency DLR are working to create SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy), a Boeing 747-SP aircraft modified to accommodate a 2.5 meter reflecting telescope. When operational, SOFIA will be the largest airborne telescope in the world, giving scientists new opportunities to study the origin of stars and planets and to ultimately understand how life arises in the universe. The conference is cosponsored by the SOFIA project and by NASA's Center for Star Formation Studies, a consortium of researchers working to construct a comprehensive theoretical model of the process of star formation. It is not open to the public. [www.astro.ucla.edu/meetings/SOFIA_Star_Formation99/][5]
