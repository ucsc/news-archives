SANTA CRUZ, CA--If playing in the sand, investigating mud,  observing elephant seals, and holding sea stars and sea snails sounds  like fun, then the new Ocean Explorers summer program at Long  Marine Lab may be for you.

Ocean Explorers is a series of seven one-week programs,  starting July 8, for children ages 7-15. Participants will join an LML  researcher on guided excursions to Monterey Bay Aquarium, Elkhorn  Slough, Ano Nuevo, and Natural Bridges. On each trip, children will  get hands-on experience working with animals and exploring  habitats. They will also go behind the scenes at Long Marine Lab to  see the workings of a major research and public-education facility,  operated by UC Santa Cruz.

The program's goal, says lead instructor Stacia Fletcher, is "to  provide a very personal educational experience that is fun and  challenging to each ocean explorer." To achieve this, instructors will  limit each week's class to eight children and will use interactive  teaching techniques such as games, arts and crafts, and explorations  of live animals at Long Marine Lab.

The first six weeks of the program will alternate between  grades 1-3 and 4-6, and the final week will be for grades 7-9.  Participants will meet each day at 9 a.m. at the Long Marine Lab  Education Building. The cost is $175.
