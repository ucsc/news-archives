**Ben Benumof,** an earth sciences graduate student, appeared on the CBS Evening News during a report on the possible effects of El Nino along the California coast. Benumof is part of a team under geologist **Gary Griggs** that is studying, in fine detail, erosion rates and processes along the San Diego County and Santa Cruz County shorelines.

The _San Francisco Weekly_ devoted its cover to the supposed controversy over whether newly discovered planets outside of our solar system even exist. Astronomer **Steve Vogt** weighed in with comments about the technology behind the research at Lick Observatory. Vogt advised leading planet hunter **Geoffrey Marcy** while he was a Ph.D. student here.

The _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ covered the out-of-this-world work of Institute of Marine Sciences researcher **Greg Rau,** who earned funding to help probe possible signs of life in that now-famous Martian meteorite.

This week's _Metro Santa Cruz_ contains an eye-grabbing cover story on the lives of great white sharks off of Ano Nuevo. Featured are alumnus **Sean van Sommeran** of the Pelagic Shark Research Foundation, Long Marine Lab veterinarian **Dave Casper,** and elephant-seal expert **Burney Le Boeuf.** E-seals, as it turns out, are prime shark munchies.

The August issue of _Architectural Record_ featured a 10-page color spread on two buildings designed recently by architect Antoine Predock--a center at Stanford and UCSC's Music Center. Project architect **Dave Tanza** was quoted several times in the story.

Extension's **Dale Stansbury** was tapped for an article in _Recycle Scene,_ a publication of the California Resource Recovery Association, to describe the lumber-salvaging efforts under way as buildings are dismantled at Fort Ord.
