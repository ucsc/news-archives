FROM: Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood

Proposition 209 is a sweeping measure affecting all public entities in California. Less than two-thirds of eligible Californians voted yesterday, and the majority of them approved the passage of Proposition 209. Santa Cruz County  was one of only seven counties in the state to vote against the  proposition. Statewide, the vote was 54.4% in favor,  and 45.6% opposed. In Santa Cruz County, the vote was 52.3% opposed and 47.7% in favor.

At this time it is too early to predict the final outcome in terms of court challenges. Nevertheless, we are required by law to abide by the provisions of the proposition effective immediately.

UC Santa Cruz remains committed to the principles of nondiscrimination  and inclusion. We must all be ever more vigilant to ensure that fairness and access remain a standard in our admissions and our hiring practices. Whether we voted for or against the proposition, we still remain partners in achieving the goals of the university.

Today I have announced to the news media our campus initiatives to ensure diversity in this new era.

I urge all members of the UCSC community to participate in these efforts. The future of California and of the country demands that  we do no less.
