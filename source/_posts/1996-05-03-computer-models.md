title: Computer Models Of Galaxy Collisions And "Tidal Tails" Yield Puzzling Results About Dark Matter Around Galaxies

SANTA CRUZ, CA--When galaxies collide, the results can be  strikingly beautiful or deadly dull. Some pairs of galaxies fling  sweeping arcs of stars into space; others just merge into shapeless  blobs. The difference, it turns out, is a matter of some gravity.

Gravity dictates the overall shapes of galaxies during a  collision, as well as the path of each star. However, the key forces  come not from the stars themselves, but from invisible "halos" of  dark matter theorized by astronomers to surround every galaxy.  Those halos can create deep gravitational pits, making it less likely  that stars will escape a collision to form graceful luminous arcs.

That delicate dance of physics allowed a team at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, to use a supercomputer model  of colliding galaxies as a novel way to probe how much dark matter  is out there. When the researchers compared their results to images  of real galaxies caught in the act of colliding, they unveiled a puzzle.

The model's collisions created dramatic "tidal tails" of stars  only when the mass of each galaxy's dark-matter halo was fairly  low--from four to eight times the mass of the visible stars. The  simulated tidal tails became pathetically short and stubby when the  team upped the dark-matter ratio to 15 to 30 times the mass of the  stars alone.

Here's the dilemma: Popular theories of the evolution of the  universe predict that galaxies should have huge cocoons of dark  matter. Some astronomical data support this view. However, several  well-known galaxy pairs have hurled tremendous tails of stars into  space. This implies--according to the computer model--that their  dark-matter halos are wimpy, not massive.

"It's not controversial that dark matter exists around  galaxies," says John Dubinski, postdoctoral researcher in astronomy  and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. "What's controversial is how  much there is. We found that our simulations can't produce these  beautiful long tidal tails if the galaxies have high-mass halos of  dark matter."

Dubinski leads the team's report in the May 10 issue of the  Astrophysical Journal. Coauthors are J. Christopher Mihos, formerly  of UCSC and now Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins  University, and Lars Hernquist, associate professor of astronomy and  astrophysics at UCSC.

At face value, the team's results suggest there is less dark  matter around galaxies than astronomers believe. However, there are  other interpretations. To date, telescopes have spotted less than a  dozen good examples of systems with long tidal tails. Those  collisions may have occurred in parts of the universe where the  concentration of matter was less dense to begin with, so that the  galaxies haven't had time to accumulate huge halos. In other regions,  galactic halos may be more massive, so that most mergers create  amorphous blobs that astronomers can't easily recognize as the  products of colliding galaxies. Our own Milky Way and the nearby  Andromeda galaxy appear headed for such a boring fate about three  billion years from now.

Hernquist describes what he feels is the real power of his  team's method: "There are ways to measure galaxy masses that  people haven't thought about," he says. "Tidal tails sample the mass  of a dark halo over large distances, which is something that other  techniques don't do." Astronomers should collect detailed images of  many colliding galaxies, he adds, for a more robust comparison with  the results of these and other simulations.

Computer models let researchers explore all stages of a galaxy  collision, which in the real universe can take a billion years or more  to unfold. Although head-on smashes between stars are unlikely  when two galaxies collide, the relentless tidal forces and slingshot  effects of gravity render the original galaxies unrecognizable by the  time the collision ends. Previous work by Hernquist and his  colleagues, for instance, showed that two spiral galaxies can merge  to form a featureless blob much like the elliptical galaxies  scattered through the universe.

The latest model by Dubinski, Mihos, and Hernquist is the first  to use high-mass halos of dark matter around galaxies. Earlier  simulations had used halos with masses up to eight times that of  the galaxy's visible material, not high enough to abort the birth of  tidal tails. The team's model also tracked the fates of a large  number of particles--48,000 in the disk, central bulge, and dark halo  of each "galaxy," yielding excellent detail throughout the encounters.

The team designed its galaxies so that their orbits and their  relative orientations would churn out the longest possible tails.  Striking tails resulted only from collisions between galaxies with  dark-matter halos either four or eight times the mass of the visible  stars. When the ratio reached 15 to 30 times, short tails crept  anemically into space before collapsing back onto the merging  galaxies. "It's like launching a rocket--it only gets so far before it  starts to fall back," Dubinski says. "If the earth was twice as  massive, the rocket would not get as far and would fall back much  more quickly."
