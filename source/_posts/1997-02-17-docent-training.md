SANTA CRUZ, CA--The UC Santa Cruz Farm and Garden is looking for  volunteer docents to help teach the principles of organic farming and  gardening to visitors who tour the Farm and Garden.

Farm and Garden docents participate in a range of activities that  include tours, public education programs, and other activities that support  the Farm and Garden. If you're interested in alternative agriculture and enjoy  working with people, consider volunteering as a docent at the 25-acre Farm  and the four-acre Alan Chadwick Garden. A docent training will take place on  six Thursdays from 1 to 5 P.M., beginning March 13.

During the training, docents will learn about the philosophies and  methods of organic farming and gardening, issues in sustainable agriculture,  and the basic principles of leading interpretive tours.  Participants will also have an opportunity to do hands-on work in the Farm  and Garden's biointensive gardens and fields. After completing the training,  docents are asked to lead two tours a month and attend monthly educational  meetings. Each docent is asked to contribute a total of four to six hours per  month.

A $25 fee covers the cost of materials, a docent manual, and an  organic cotton T-shirt. Class size is limited, so advance registration is  recommended. Applications and other materials are available from Melanie  Mintz at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, 1156  High Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95064-1077, or by calling (408) 459-3248.
