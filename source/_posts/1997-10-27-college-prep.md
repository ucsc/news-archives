SANTA CRUZ, CA--An ambitious new partnership between the East Side  Union High School District and the University of California, Santa Cruz, will  dramatically improve college participation rates of students from East San  Jose.

The goals of the partnership are to improve the academic preparation  of students in the district and to increase the number of students who enroll  at UC campuses. To that end, UCSC faculty and staff are teaming up with  district personnel to build programs that will help students prepare for  college, meet college admissions requirements, apply, and enroll.

Services being offered to each of the 10 high schools in the district  include:
* Faculty-to-faculty support in which English and math faculty from  UCSC meet with their ESUHSD counterparts to exchange ideas.
* Intensive tutoring for students.
* Creation of Parent Advisory Boards to facilitate parent involvement  throughout the partnership.
* Information and counseling services for students during the college  application period, and biweekly site visits from October 20 to November 25.

In the spring, three schools will also host an intensive academic  enrichment program known as "Saturday College." Fifty students each from  James Lick, W. C. Overfelt, and Yerba Buena High Schools will be selected to  participate in a seven-week program that emphasizes math and English  instruction.

In addition, UCSC is tailoring programs and services to meet the  individual needs of schools as identified by principals and school  administrators. Some of those services include scholarship search training  for career counselors, analysis of standardized test results, access to UC  libraries and public events, and university field trips.

"Our goal is to provide a full host of academic support and outreach  services to economically disadvantaged students in one of the most racially  diverse districts in California," said Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor  for student affairs at UCSC. "Research shows that these types of early  academic outreach efforts can make all the difference. A lot of these kids  have the potential to be the first in their families to attend college. It's our  job to help make them aware of their educational options and to help them  make decisions that will keep those options open for them."

The East Side Union High School District has grown from just under  13,000 students in 1968 to more than 24,000 this year. Latinos make up 38  percent of the student body, followed by Asians (34 percent), whites (20  percent), African Americans (7 percent), and American Indians (1 percent).  More than 30 percent of students have limited English skills, and only 36  percent of all students take the courses that satisfy the University of  California's eligibility requirements.

"This collaboration has the potential to make a big difference in the  lives of our students," said Joe Coto, superintendent of the East Side Union  High School District. "I believe we'll see a measurable impact right away.  Our students, parents, teachers, counselors, and administrators are eager to  get to work."

The UC Santa Cruz/East Side Union High School District partnership is  being funded by a $165,000 grant from the University of California. The  effort is one of several regional partnerships being launched statewide this  year at the initiative of the University's Outreach Task Force. The goal of the  task force is to promote collaborations between UC campuses and K-12  schools where disadvantaged students are enrolled in large numbers. The  funding is designed to build the infrastructure for a long-term association.

"We want to extend the academic partnerships we've had in the  Monterey Bay region into the Santa Clara Valley," added Hernandez. "The  Santa Clara Valley has always been part of our service area, and we've  always had early academic outreach programs there, but we want to enhance  our effort and leverage our resources in partnership with the school district  so that the students benefit."
