The popular market cart at UC Santa Cruz opens on Tuesday, June 16, bringing the fresh organic bounty of the UCSC Farm & Garden to cooks and flower lovers twice a week through early fall.

Located at the main entrance of campus, the market cart features picked-that-morning fruit, vegetables, and flowers. It will be open every Tuesday and Friday from noon until 6 p.m. in front of the Barn Theater at the intersection of Bay and High streets.

Back again this year will be the cart's popular $5 bouquets, featuring sweet peas, larkspur, alstromeria, foxgloves, coreopsis, and coming soon, dramatic sunflowers. The array of fresh organic fruits and vegetables grows as the season progresses, but early offerings include tender lettuces, sweet carrots, tasty beets, and tangy chard. Later in the summer, watch for sweet corn, flavorful dry-farmed tomatoes, gourmet potatoes, an array of sweet and hot peppers, apples, basil and other herbs, and more.

The cart will be open through the summer and into the fall, depending on the length of the growing season. All proceeds benefit the UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems' apprenticeship program in ecological horticulture. For more information, call (408) 459-3240.
