## Docents Needed At The UC Santa Cruz Farm & Garden

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The UC Santa Cruz Farm & Garden is looking for volunteer docents to help teach the principles of organic farming and gardening to visitors who tour the Farm & Garden.

Farm & Garden docents participate in a range of activities that include tours, public education programs, and other activities that support the Farm & Garden. If you're interested in alternative agriculture and enjoy working with people, consider volunteering as a docent at the 25-acre Farm and the four-acre Alan Chadwick Garden. A docent training will take place on eight Thursdays from 1 to 6 p.m., beginning March 2. The first session will include a no-obligation orientation and Farm tour for those who want to know more about the opportunities available to docents.

During the training, docents will learn about the philosophies and methods of organic farming and gardening, issues in sustainable agriculture, and the basic principles of environmental interpretation. Participants will also have an opportunity to do hands-on work in the Farm & Garden's biointensive gardens and fields. After completing the training, docents are asked to lead two tours a month and attend monthly educational meetings. The total time commitment is about six hours per month. Docents have the option of working with adult visitors or children.

A $30 fee covers the cost of materials, a docent manual, parking passes, and an organic cotton T-shirt. Class size is limited, so advance registration is recommended. Applications and other materials are available from John Fisher at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, UC Santa Cruz, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, or by calling (831) 459-3248.
