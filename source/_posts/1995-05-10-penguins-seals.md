SANTA CRUZ, CA--Balancing the demands of work and family is  always a struggle, even for seals and penguins. Daniel Costa, a  marine biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will  examine some of these marine family values in a free public lecture  at 8 p.m. Wednesday, June 7, in the UCSC Concert Hall.

Costa's talk is entitled "Penguins, Seals, Sea Lions, and Fur  Seals: How to Make a Living When You Feed at Sea but Return to Shore  to Breed." Encompassing fifteen years of research, the talk will  highlight the different strategies that birds and mammals have  adopted to feed at sea.

Fur seals and penguins, Costa has discovered, are remarkably  similar in the way they gather food and nurture their young. Both  make many foraging trips to sea, and both invest heavily in big, fat  babies. "That's what's interesting about penguins and fur seals," says  Costa, a professor of biology. "They're very evolutionarily distinct  animals, but they had to solve the same problem."

"True" seals, such as harbor seals and northern elephant seals,  found a different solution, one appropriate for their large body size.  Instead of nursing pups to the size of adults, they wean pups at a  young age and teach them to forage.

Costa has traveled the world to study his animals: fairy  penguins in Australia, fur seals in Alaska, emperor penguins in  Antarctica. To complete the picture, he even looks at ancient seals  from the fossil record. "I like broad brush strokes," Costa says. "I try  to tease apart a broad question by comparing different animal  groups."

Because he studies marine mammals for the Acoustic  Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) project, a controversial  proposal to send underwater sounds across the Pacific, Costa also  has spent many hours lately talking to reporters. "I really don't mind  the media," he says. "It's important to let people know what you do  and why you do it."

Costa's talk is part of a series of inaugural lectures designed  to recognize recently promoted faculty members. The talk is  cosponsored by Arts & Lectures, the UCSC Affiliates, and the  Chancellor's Office. For further information, call the UCSC Public  Information Office at 459-2495.
