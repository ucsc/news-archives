**Professor Encourages Teachers And Others To Tape The Broadcast For  Educational And Personal Use**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The premiere broadcast of La Charreada! Rodeo a la  Mexicana, a 27-minute documentary about Mexican rodeo, will take place on  Monday, May 19, at 10 P.M. on Channel 68, KTEH-TV, San Jose's public  television station.

The documentary provides an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at the  traditions of Mexican rodeo. Interviews with more than a dozen rodeo  participants capture the vital cultural link that "la charreada" represents in  the United States for Mexicans and Mexican Americans. The program was  written, produced, and directed by Olga Najera-Ramirez, an associate  professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. It was  produced in collaboration with KTEH-TV.

The program recently garnered a Silver Apple Award in the 1997  National Educational Film and Video Festival. Najera-Ramirez, who is not  distributing the video commercially, encourages educators to videotape the  program and use it as a tool in classrooms.

"I am giving viewers blanket permission to tape this show off the air  for educational and personal use," said Najera-Ramirez, who is eager to  share her research with the public. "My mother won't read an academic  journal, and I don't blame her, but she'll turn on the TV and watch an  educational program on charreada."

The "charreada" tradition emerged in Mexico during the 16th century  and enjoys a strong following on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border today.  In addition to showcasing the sport of horsemanship and roping, it offers a  popular, culturally rooted, family-based form of entertainment that  continues to inspire poetry, music, painting, and dance, said Najera-Ramirez,  whose documentary also touches upon some of the criticisms waged by  animal-rights activists.
