All alumni, current and prospective students, and their families and friends are invited to visit UCSC for the Banana Slug Spring Fair on Saturday, April 18. Last year, more than 4,250 people attended the fair.

This year's campus open house features a faculty lecture, alumni reunions, tours of the colleges and special facilities, student support-services workshops, and presentations by UCSC's programs in the arts, engineering, humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences. Also planned this year are student-life and academic fairs and an evening student recital in the Music Center.

For more information, contact University Advancement or the Office of Admissions.

Highlights of the 1998 fair include:
* The All-Class Reunion Luncheon, an anchor event for all alumni, recognizing the classes of '68, '73, '78, '83, '88, and '93. Everyone is welcome.
* An evening of conversation, dancing, and reminiscence, celebrating the 20-year reunion of the class of '78.
* Receptions at each college; Cowell's annual evening waltz; a celebration of Asian culture at Porter; a moat-painting party for Merrill students; and a dedication ceremony for the Oakes library.
* A special reunion for economics majors; College Eight's 25th anniversary dinner and dance; and a Sunday, April 19, picnic for classics majors and a gathering at the Santa Cruz Hillel center for UCSC alumni.
* "Looking Forward, Looking Backward, Looking Under the Bed," a special faculty lecture by Marge Frantz, American studies and women's studies lecturer emerita. Frantz, who is this year's Alumni Association Distinguished Teaching Award recipient, will also be honored by Kresge College with alumni panel discussions on political activism and education.
* A Shakespeare To Go performance of _Much Ado About Nothing._
* A presentation titled "The White Gallery: Poems and Paintings." by Professor Emeritus Douglas McClellan and Professor John Dizikes at Cowell College.
