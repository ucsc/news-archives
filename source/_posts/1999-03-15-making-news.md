Even the most serious journalists couldn't resist the story of a horoscope recently discovered by UCSC astronomer **Anthony Misch.** Of course, this horoscope appeared on a 400-year-old piece of paper and was penned by the famous astronomer Johannes Keppler. Misch and librarian **Alan Ritch** gave the better part of their week to speaking with media about the discovery, which was covered by TV crews from Santa Cruz, San Jose, and San Francisco, as well as in the _New York Times,_ the _Washington Post,_ the _San Jose Mercury News,_ the [_San Francisco Chronicle,][3]_ Reuters, AP, and on NPR. International media covered the story in Japan, China, Germany, Australia, Spain, France, and Brazil.

A columnist for Mexico's national newsweekly, _Proceso,_ credited **Jonathan Fox** of Latin American and Latino studies for his work on clientelism and politics, saying it was the best work on the subject.

Research on bald eagles by UCSC's **Predatory Bird Research Group** was the focus of articles in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel,_ the _San Jose Mercury News,_ and several other newspapers which carried an Associated Press story about the research. Researchers **Janet Linthicum, Ron Jackman,** and **Brian Latta** were all featured in the stories.

**Daniel Press** fielded calls from the _San Francisco Examiner_ and the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ in the wake of the murder of Terry Freitas, a UCSC grad who had taken Press's environmental policy classes. . . . On an upbeat note, **Press** also appeared on KUSP Radio to discuss his research on the politics of open space in California.

Professor emeritus of biology **John Pearse, **professor of physics **Stanley Flatte,** and professor of psychology **Bruce Bridgeman** published an opinion piece in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ opposing Measure N, which bans fluoridation of the city water supply. Writing as representatives of the UCSC chapter of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society, the authors argued that fluoride's benefits outweigh its risks.

A team from Mission San Jose High in Fremont beat out Watsonville High in the Northern California Ocean Sciences Bowl, organized by coordinator **Lisa Borok** and held at UCSC in February. The event was covered on KION (Channel 46) and KCBA (Channel 35), and in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel,_ the _Fremont Argus,_ and the _Watsonville Register-Pajaronian._

As an advance to his faculty research lecture, KSBW-Channel 8 ran a feature on the work of **David Cope. **

Cataloger **Rolf Augustine** was the subject of more media attention for his gift last year of $100,000 to the University Library. This time, the story was covered on KION-Channel 46. Also interviewed for the story was librarian **Allan Dyson.**

Research by Agroecology's **Sean Swezey** was mentioned briefly in a _New York Times_ opus on artichokes. Swezey is working with local growers to develop organic production techniques.
