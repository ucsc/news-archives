title: Ice Cream Social Launches United Way Campaign
author: UCSC Currents

UCSC will kick off its annual United Way campaign on Monday, October 13, with a lunchtime ice-cream social. Chancellor Greenwood and other administrators will serve ice cream at the social, which will take place from 11:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. at McHenry Library.

Joyce Justus, special assistant to the chancellor, will act as a "trainer" for the scooping process, said Carol Lacey of the Chancellor's Office, who is organizing this year's campaign.

The kickoff event will feature speakers from a nonprofit agency served by United Way, and from a non-United Way agency, Lacey said. Staff Advisory Board chair Vege Clerisse will answer questions from the audience, Chancellor Greenwood will act as master of ceremonies, and EVC Michael Tanner will speak as the campus representative on the United Way Board of Directors.

This year's United Way campaign will run through November 15. Last year, faculty and staff contributed a total of $70,169 to the nonprofit organization, earning the university the Gold Award as the highest donor in the education division.
