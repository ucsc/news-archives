Historian **Gail Hershatter** has received the American Historical Association's 1998 Joan Kelly Memorial Prize for her book, _Dangerous Pleasures: Prostitution and Modernity in Twentieth-Century Shanghai_ (University of California Press, 1997). In announcing the award, the association noted, "This study of prostitution in Shanghai illuminates not only the various ways the institution is constructed but also the social and political history of 20th-century China. Characterized by careful research, a comparative perspective, sophisticated methodology, and lively presentation, this book shows the complex interaction between those involved, those who wrote about, and those who regulated the sex trade. Hershatter raises issues that stimulate the thinking of historians no matter what their special fields."

Slug swimmers finished another highly successful season under sixth-year coach **Mickey Wender.** For the third season in a row, the Slugs were in the top 10 in NCAA Division III. The women placed ninth at the 1998 NCAA nationals in St. Louis. The women's top finisher was **Lindsay Kircher** with a sixth-place finish in the 100-yard butterfly, and the 400-yard freestyle relay team of **Christine Caurant,** Kircher, **Emily Dashiell,** and **Gina Vittori** finished seventh. For the men, **Dave Reid** took fourth in the 1,650-yard freestyle, the highest finish ever for Slug men at the NCAA nationals (with the exception of Matt Humphries, NCAA champion and runner-up three times).
