title: Clerical And Allied Services Unit Chooses New Representation
author: UCSC Currents
---

Members of the Clerical and Allied Services Unit voted for a new exclusive representative in a recertification election held earlier this month.

The Coalition of University Employees (CUE) received a majority of the votes in the November 5 vote count, winning the right to exclusively represent the unit systemwide. The unit had been represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) since 1983.

Out of 6,340 valid votes cast, CUE received 3,955 and AFSCME received 1,346. The remainder of votes were cast for "no representation."

More than 18,000 employees systemwide are members of the Clerical and Allied Services Unit. The wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment described in the current UC/AFSCME contract will continue to apply to them until a new agreement is negotiated between UC and CUE. These include 1997-98 wage increases and changes to Shift Differential and Transfer/Promotion/Reclassification articles recently negotiated by AFSCME.

AFSCME will continue to represent the Service Unit, Patient Care Technical Unit, and UCSC's Skilled Crafts employees.
