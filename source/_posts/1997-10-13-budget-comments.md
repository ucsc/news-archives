Governor Wilson's veto of AB 1415 is a disappointment. I remain hopeful, however, that we can solve the serious long-term funding needs of publ ic higher education in our state. Even though the governor vetoed this specific measure, he affirmed his strong commitment to higher education, its importance to the future of our state and his desire to develop an alternative funding method. Speaker Bustamante demonstrated his personal commitment to higher education as well, in the vision and leadership he displayed with regard to AB 1415 as did the Legislature in its support of this measure.

We will continue to work with the governor, the speaker and the Legislature to insure that California's colleges and universities are adequately funded to maintain their quality and affordability as we face the enormous challenge in the decade ahead of accommodating the large number of students who will seek admission. AB 1415 would have provided the stable base of funding needed to serve these students. Now, unfortunately, the outlook for them is less certain. Working together, we can remove this uncertainty.
