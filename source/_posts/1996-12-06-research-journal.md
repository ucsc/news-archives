title: Santa Cruz High School Teacher And UCSC Graduate Publishes Research In Prestigious Journal

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A quick scan of the Journal of the American  Chemical Society, a leading journal for original research in  chemistry, reveals reams of papers by teams of scientists at  universities and industries. Rare is the paper written by just one  person, and rarer still is that author from a high school. Yet both of  those things happened in the issue of September 11, 1996, when  Santa Cruz High School chemistry teacher Dave Ptak published his  study on the stability of a special kind of protein.

The two-page paper, titled "Effects of Electrostatic  Anisotropy on the Properties of de Novo 4-Alpha-Helix Bundles," is  not exactly coffee-table reading. Indeed, it is the fruition of several  years' worth of serious theoretical research by Ptak, done in the  spare time he managed to carve from his hectic schedule. The study  proposes a model for why a particular class of synthetic protein  isn't as stable as chemists think it should be. Ptak's model explains  why the proteins might vibrate in a distinctive way and predicts  how chemists might be able to construct more sturdy versions of  them.

Ptak got the idea for his paper while taking classes for a  master's degree in chemistry, which he earned from UC Santa Cruz in  1992\. After finishing his courses he opted to return to Santa Cruz  High School, where he has taught since 1986. His degree did allow  him to take on part-time teaching duties in chemistry at Cabrillo  College and Monterey Peninsula College. Along the way, his interests  in theoretical chemistry research have continued unabated.

"It's like a passion for me," Ptak says. "I'm a member of both  the American Chemical Society and the Protein Society, and I read a  lot of research journals. There's also a tremendous amount of  information available on the World Wide Web." Although his  published work is too technical for his students to tackle, Ptak  created a special unit on proteins that he will teach as part of a new  Advanced Placement chemistry course at the high school in spring  1997.

Ptak found the journal's publication process rigorous but  rewarding. The most tangible result: He's gotten requests for more  information from chemists across the U.S. and from countries such  as France, Spain, and Lithuania.
