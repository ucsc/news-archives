SANTA CRUZ, CA--Kids ages 8 to 12 are invited to come spend the day at the Farm at the University of California, Santa Cruz, on Saturday, June 26, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

This special event, "Kids Day on the Farm," will combine fun, games, and education as participants explore the Farm, get a feel for harvesting vegetables, and participate in garden activities and crafts.

"We'll learn what farmers produce," said John Fisher, outreach coordinator for the UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, who sums up the fun with a rhyme: "The sun, soil, water, and air make everything we eat and wear."

The day will begin with a tour of the Farm, which will be followed by harvesting and preparing a snack. If the sun cooperates, kids will even get to try their hand at solar cooking, said Fisher.

The fee is $6, or $4 for children of members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden. Enrollment is limited to 15 children, so preregistration is required. Call Fisher at (831) 459-3248, or send him email at [johnfish@cats.ucsc.edu](johnfish@cats.ucsc.edu). Children are asked to bring their own lunch.
