**State Of The Ocean Address: The Sverdrup Lecture Monday, February 12, 1:30 P.m. Speaker: Margaret Delaney**

Levels of carbon dioxide in the air. Temperatures of the  tropical sea surface. "Conveyor belts" in the ocean linking high and  low latitudes. These, says Margaret Delaney, are some of the  challenges facing the burgeoning field of paleoceanography. The  discipline, Delaney says, is maturing into one that can help  scientists understand our planet--providing not just snapshots of  long-lost eras, but clues about what the future may portend.

Delaney, an associate professor of marine sciences at UC Santa  Cruz, will deliver the annual Sverdrup Lecture in paleoceanography,  named for the late Scandinavian oceanographer H. U. Sverdrup.  Delaney last month became the fourth editor of the international  journal Paleoceanography, founded in 1986 to help unite chemists,  oceanographers, geologists, climatologists, and others who  contribute to broad-based studies of how earth's oceans have  changed over time.

Paleoceanographers have a growing toolbox at their disposal to  probe ever more finely into the recent history of the oceans and ever  more deeply into the distant past. Fast computer models, advances in  drilling technology, careful analysis of sediments and fossilized  organisms, and clever uses of the isotopes of oxygen, strontium, and  other elements all have turned new pages in the marine record books.

"Researchers have detailed ice-core records about earth's  atmosphere and climate for the last few hundred thousand years,"  Delaney says. "Now, we're getting the same sort of information from  the ocean on that timescale. We can compare those data sets to work  toward understanding how the ocean, atmosphere, and climate are  linked."

However, ice cores can't help scientists peer tens of millions  of years back in time, to eras when earth's climate was radically  different than it is today. Instead, clues lurk in various places on  land and beneath the ocean floor. "There are a hundred million years  of records in the ocean, which we can use to get at long-term links  between the ocean and the climate," Delaney says. "But it's a matter  of learning how to interpret all of the data--that's the major issue  in the field today."

One example is the dispute over how much the temperature of  the tropical ocean--the planet's biggest reservoir of heat--can  change. Some studies point to stable temperatures; others suggest  large warmings and coolings. It's a crucial issue for sorting out how  oceans affect earth's heat budget and, ultimately, how they drive  short-term and long-term changes in climate and geochemistry.

Paleoceanography, says Delaney, is a going concern precisely  because of this potential to shed light on earth's seemingly fickle  thermostat. "Our oceanic records aren't on the same timescale as the  current human impacts on the environment, but we do see rapid  forcings and responses," she says. "Oceanographers and  meteorologists tell us the way things are; as paleoceanogaphers we  tell you the range of ways things were--and may be again."

Metals in S.F. Bay sediments may repeatedly contaminate the water Monday, February 12, 3:30 p.m. Speaker: Ignacio Rivera-Duarte (408) 459-2088 or iriverad@cats.ucsc.edu

Preliminary measurements of trace metals in the waters and  sediments of San Francisco Bay suggest that cleaning the most  polluted parts of the bay could be a Sisyphean task. A chronic supply  of metals in contaminated sediments may rise into the water for  decades, confounding the attempts of regulators to purge toxic  metals from the wastes of industry and civilization.

Scientists face more work to confirm that bleak scenario. But  early studies at two sites in the far southern reaches of San  Francisco Bay hint that metals re-emerging from sediments  contaminate the water at least as much as--if not more than--all of  the runoff and discharges from streets, sewers, and factories  combined.

Toxicologist Ignacio Rivera-Duarte, a postdoctoral researcher  at UC Santa Cruz, collected water and sediments at several spots in  San Francisco Bay during the summer, when water circulates most  sluggishly. In southernmost San Francisco Bay, near San Jose, levels  of copper and nickel in the water often exceed federal safety  guidelines at that time of year.

Rivera-Duarte used painstaking ultraclean methods to  determine the concentrations of copper, nickel, cadmium, cobalt, and  zinc in the water, as well as in "porewaters" that squeeze among the  grains of sediments. The data, among the first reliable  measurements of trace metals in porewaters, were accurate to  within a part per trillion. Such fine level of detail allowed Rivera-Duarte to paint a picture of the relative rates at which  metals flow into the bay's waters, then into the sediments via tiny  plant cells that sink to the bottom, then back into the water when  the plants decay.

That "remobilization" of trace metals from sediments turned  out to be the biggest source of all of the metals in the water except  cadmium, Rivera-Duarte found. He and his colleagues speculate that  at heavily polluted sites in the southern San Francisco Bay, metals  buried in the sediments years ago may continue to infiltrate the  water for the foreseeable future, like sap that still oozes from  telephone poles. As a result, that part of the bay may have prolonged  problems with trace metals even if regulations demand that sewage,  industrial wastewater, and other effluents be virtually free of  potentially toxic substances.

Research team leader Russell Flegal, professor of earth  sciences at UCSC, says the work corroborates similar studies his  group has performed in San Diego Bay, parts of which are similar to  San Francisco Bay. However, he emphasizes the need for further  research, both at different times of year and at more sites within  both bays.

"These studies show that we should take remobilization from  sediments into account when we try to understand sources of trace-metal contamination in severely impacted bays," Flegal says.  "However, we are not saying that contaminated wastewater is no  longer a issue. New inputs from wastewater discharges and surface  runoff would only add to the problem."

Some results from the IronEx-II ocean fertilization experiment Thursday, February 15, 11:30 a.m. Speaker: Eden Rue (408/459-2585 or elrue@cats.ucsc.edu) Thursday, February 15, 4 p.m. Speaker: Marta Sanderson (408/459-2682 or mps@cats.ucsc.edu)

The sea turned green with a teeming bloom of tiny marine  plants when scientists fortified the water with a half-ton of iron.  The June 1995 experiment, called IronEx-II, vividly confirmed that  marine plants are stunted by the iron-poor waters of the equatorial  Pacific. Encouraging worldwide plant growth with iron supplements,  some scientists have suggested, could soak up enough carbon dioxide  from the atmosphere via photosynthesis to slow global warming.  Many researchers remain dubious about such global engineering, but  they were eager to study the fascinating interactions between sea  life and the chemistry of the ocean.

For instance, iron's chemical associations in the sea had been  somewhat of a mystery. Before the cruise, UC Santa Cruz  postdoctoral researcher Eden Rue found that almost all dissolved  iron in the ocean acts like a celebrity leaving a limo: it attracts  hordes of devoted molecular fans, in the guise of strongly binding  organic molecules. But because biologists had assumed that the tiny  plants called phytoplankton could only consume inorganic iron, Rue's  discovery raised questions about what form of iron the plants  actually use.

Working in an ultraclean lab lashed to the rolling ship, Rue  measured the different types of iron forms by adhering bound iron  onto a drop of mercury--an electrochemical technique she devised at  UCSC. The hundredfold increase in iron during the cruise not only  turned the water green with plants, but as Rue found, quadrupled the  amount of iron binding molecules in less than a day.

Phytoplankton apparently can thrive even if nearly all the iron  is bound. In fact, Rue suspects that plants somehow produce binding  molecules to capture the dissolved iron, which may otherwise clump  into particles and settle to the seafloor. Rue compares the dose of  iron to a smorgasbord for phytoplankton. Producing the binding  molecules, she says, "may be a way for them to stack food on their  plates." No one knows yet how the plants get the iron into their  cells, but clues gathered by Rue suggest that it enters with the aid  of a molecular entourage.

A puzzle of the first iron-seeding experiment, IronEx-I in  1993, was that plants grew less vigorously than expected. One  proposed reason is that as the tiny plants gorge themselves on iron,  they also crave yet another nutrient: silica and/or zinc. To test the  idea, UCSC graduate student Marta Sanderson added different  nutrients to pristine seawater. A dose of iron by itself spurred an  18-fold increase in plant growth. But silica and iron together  increased growth more than 40-fold.

"When you add iron, you stimulate the growth of diatoms," says  Sanderson, "but they also need silica to grow their skeletal shells."  Charting the dietary needs of these plants will help scientists  clarify marine biogeochemical cycles: the complex paths that iron,  silica, carbon, and other elements travel among land, sea, and living  organisms.
