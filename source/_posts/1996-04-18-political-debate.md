author: Barbara McKenna

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A lecture series presented jointly by the  Humanities Division at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and  the Art Museum of Santa Cruz County continues on May 8 with the  talk, "Abundant Righteousness: Moralism in Contemporary Political  Life." The talk is presented by UCSC professor of women's studies  and legal studies Wendy Brown and is free and open to the public. It  takes place from 7 to 8 p.m. at the McPherson Center for Art and  History, 705 Front St., Santa Cruz. A reception follows.

Why is contemporary political discourse so steeped in  moralistic claims and rebukes? From "political correctness" on the  left to talk of "family values" on the right, what makes political  moralizing so common in our time? How might such moralizing be  read as a symptom of certain contemporary losses and confusions?  In her talk, Brown will examine the tendency toward moralizing in  political life and consider what prevents more useful and generous  forms of thinking and discussion about justice.

Brown's most recent book is States of Injury: Power and  Freedom in Late Modernity (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University  Press, 1995). She is codirector of UCSC's Center for Cultural Studies  and chair of the Advisory Board to the UC Humanities Research  Institute.

The lecture series runs through June 12 on the second  Wednesday of each month, offering a range of lively topics of  interest to the general public. For more information, call the  Humanities Division at (408) 459-2696 or the Art Museum at (408)  429-1964.
