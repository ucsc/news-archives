Sheila Hough, a longtime lecturer and fellow of Stevenson College, lost her fight against cancer on April 27. She was 67.

Beginning her affiliation with UCSC and Stevenson College in January 1966, Hough served the campus in many capacities for 25 years before  retiring in 1991. She was a lecturer for the Modern Society and  Social Thought Program, a lecturer in the Stevenson Core Course, the administrative  coordinator for the Stevenson Core Course, and a counseling psychologist.

Hough, whose work was instrumental in the development of the academic programs for the Stevenson Core Course and the Modern Society and Social Thought Program,  will also be remembered by the many students she so enthusiasitically and devotedly served as teacher and counselor and by her faculty and staff friends and colleagues who respected her wide reading and vivacious interests and engagements in many diverse subjects.

As was her wish, many of her friends will gather for a memorial dinner and social occasion in lieu of a memorial service.

Stevenson provost, Tyler Stovall, also plans to dedicate a picnic table and plant a tree to honor Hough's many contributions to the college.
