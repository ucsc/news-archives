author: Barbara McKenna
---

Noted author Pat Cadigan is concluding a national tour in Santa Cruz with a reading/booksigning at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, October 20, in Kresge College, Room 159. The event is free and open to the public.

Pat Cadigan, acclaimed by the _London Guardian_ as "The Queen of Cyberpunk," is the author of four novels, _Mindplayers, Synners, Fools,_ and her latest, _Tea from an Empty Cup _. She received the Clarke Award for both _Synners_ and _Fools_\--the only person to win the award twice.

She is the author of three short-story collections, _Patterns, Home by the Sea,_ and _Dirty Work._ Her Hugo- and Nebula Award-nominated short stories have appeared in such magazines as _Omni, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction,_ and _Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine,_ as well as numerous anthologies. Her first collection, _Patterns,_ received the Locus Award in 1990.

Along with her fiction work, Cadigan recently authored her first major nonfiction book, _The Making of Lost in Space: The Movie._ The book was released in April 1998 to coincide with the release of the film. Cadigan is currently working on a similar project for the upcoming film, _Mummies._

The Santa Cruz event is sponsored by Another Scene, a center for the study of digital culture directed by Earl Jackson Jr., associate professor of literature at UCSC. For more information, call (415) 648-7188.

**Reviews Of _Tea From An Empty Cup_**

**_Matrix 133,_ Sep/Oct 1998: **

Fast-paced and exciting, it's a wittily written cyberpunk thriller largely set in virtual reality, where there seems to be a killer at large. . . . Whether you treat it as a satire or simply as a thriller, it's that rare animal, 'a good read'. Recommended.

**_San Francisco Chronicle,_ September 1998**

Cadigan is often identified as a cyberpunk writer, although I find her work far more straight-forward and credible than that of others in that subgenre. . . . A plausible mystery, believable characters and situations and a clean, crisp writing style make this one a sure winner.

**_Sunday Express,_ September 13, 1998**

The title refers to the illusion of creating something from nothing, an idea that's at work throughout different levels of the novel and can, to a degree, symbolize the virtual reality setting of the story. . . . What begins as a routine cyberspace mystery has, by the final chapters, become something altogether trickier.

**_Publishers Weekly,_ September 21, 1998 **

A gritty and downbeat tale of multiple murders, exchanged identities and cybernetic sado-masochism. Konstantin, the embittered cop, and Yuki, the rootless nisei, are effective protagonists, but, as is often the case in Cadigan's work, the author's pyrotechnic style and intensely detailed descriptions of cyberspace are the major attractions. This well-done example of cyberpunk noire detective fiction should especially appeal to fans of William Gibson.
