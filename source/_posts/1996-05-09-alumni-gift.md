**Endowment Is Largest Alumni Gift In UC Santa Cruz History**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--An Aptos, Calif., couple with a long-standing  commitment to local arts and culture has made a gift of $250,000 to  the University of California, Santa Cruz, to establish an endowed  chair in art history.

The gift comes from Rowland "Reb" and Patricia "Pat" Rebele.  Patricia Rebele graduated from UCSC as a re-entry student in 1988,  earning a B.A. in art history. The donation is the largest alumni  contribution in UCSC history.

"Art history is a particular love of mine," said Patricia Rebele,  "not only because I love art, but because it involves so many cultures  and teaches so much about other people and civilizations. I had a  wonderful experience at UCSC, and I would love to see the campus  put on the map as a great place to study art history. We hope the  chair will broaden and strengthen the program and foster  collaborative endeavors between the art history program and the  larger Santa Cruz community."

The endowment will support a number of activities--the  appointment of a distinguished professor to the Patricia and  Rowland Rebele Endowed Chair in Art History; periodic appointments  of outstanding art historians as scholars-in-residence; art history  symposia on an international level; and presentations of special  lectures and colloquia involving students, faculty, visitors, and  members of the community.

"It is a great pleasure to receive this gift," said UCSC  Chancellor Karl Pister. "The Rebeles' generosity will greatly enrich  an already strong program, offering students a broader scope of  study through classes and colloquia with visiting scholars.  Additionally, the public programs the endowment supports will  create wonderful opportunities for joint efforts between the campus  and local organizations."

According to Edward Houghton, dean of the arts at UCSC, the  Rebele Endowed Chair in Art History will benefit present and future  generations of all involved in the art history program. "It will  support excellence in the program and increase its national and  international visibility and impact. This is a most generous gift that  recognizes the excellence of the faculty whose teaching forms the  foundation of the endowment. It will make a significant difference  to the students, faculty, and friends of art history."

"It is thrilling to receive this gift to broaden our program,"  said Virginia Jansen, chair of UCSC's Committee of Studies in Art  History and a professor of art history. "It represents a wonderful  opportunity for the art history program, the campus, and the Santa  Cruz community. It is especially rewarding to be honored by one of  our own alumna. We thank her and her husband very much for their  magnanimous gift."

The Rebeles have supported numerous programs at UCSC for  more than a decade, including the Leadership Opportunity Awards  scholarships and Shakespeare Santa Cruz. They are the parents of  three grown children and co-owners of the Paradise Post and  Paradise Post Printing in Paradise, Calif., and a group of weekly  newspapers in southeastern Minnesota. The couple also own and co- own several small businesses in California and Texas.

Patricia Rebele, who is retired from a career in newspaper  publishing, is a trustee of the UCSC Foundation Board, serves on the  board of Battered Women's Assistance, and is active at St. John's  Episcopal Church in Capitola. She has served as a trustee and  volunteer docent of the Art Museum of Santa Cruz County and is a  former board member of the Santa Cruz AIDS Project. In 1982 she  served as president of the Women of California Newspaper  Publishers Association.

Rowland Rebele, who has been in publishing for more than 40  years, is an honorary trustee of the Greater Santa Cruz County  Community Foundation (of which the Rebeles are founding donors),  serves on the Performing Arts Facility Committee of the Cultural  Council of Santa Cruz County, and was president of the Santa Cruz  County Symphony from 1981 to 1986. He was named Man of the Year  in 1988 by the Aptos Chamber of Commerce and served as president  of the California Newspaper Publishers Association in 1988. He is a  director of the California First Amendment Coalition in Sacramento,  an organization formed to protect and preserve First Amendment  rights and openness in government and public records.
