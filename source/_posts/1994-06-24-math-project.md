## Summer Institute To Run July 6-21 At UC Santa Cruz

SANTA CRUZ, CA--If you think that only squares like math, you  probably had an old-fashioned education: Dull lesson plans, lots of  rote exercises, and nothing that seemed to apply to your life. Think  again: Teachers are no longer slaves to dry textbooks, and math class  has become a livelier part of the school day. But that transition is an  ongoing challenge for teachers, and the Monterey Bay Area  Mathematics Project is there to help.

The project helps K-12 teachers invigorate their work with  hands-on activities that prompt students to think critically,  cooperate, and learn how mathematics affects their world. Based at  UC Santa Cruz, the project is now in its ninth year and has enrolled  more than 200 teachers from schools in the counties of Monterey,  San Benito, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz.

"We try to get rid of the 'fear factor'--the high anxiety that  many teachers have about math," says Edward Migliore, lead  instructor for the project and mathematics lecturer at both UCSC  and Monterey Peninsula College. "When the teachers learn how to  solve problems, they come away with a sense of confidence. That  gets communicated in the classroom."

This year, 30 teachers of students in grades 1-8 will attend a  summer institute July 6-21 at UCSC and will participate in follow- up activities during the academic year. Project organizers make a  special effort to reach out to teachers of underrepresented minority  students in the region.

A team of teachers from area schools and community colleges- -including many veterans of previous summer institutes--will join  Migliore to teach new and exciting approaches to problem solving,  statistics, logic, discrete mathematics, and other topics.  Participants will use "replacement units" to supplement parts of  their curriculum, such as probability and statistics. Each day,  teachers will gather by grade level to discuss how to implement the  day's lessons in their classrooms and swap ideas on making the best  use of limited resources.

The UCSC program is part of the California Mathematics  Project, which sponsors institutes on eighteen University of  California or California State University campuses across the state.
