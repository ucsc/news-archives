SANTA CRUZ, CA--Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood of the University of  California, Santa Cruz, a nationally recognized biologist, spokesperson for  higher education, and an experienced voice in the arena of national scientific  policy, has been chosen by her peers as the next president-elect of the  American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).

Greenwood's one-year term as president-elect will start on February  19, immediately after the association's annual meeting in Seattle. She will  become president in 1998, and then will chair the AAAS Board of Directors  for one year beginning in 1999. Greenwood is the tenth woman--and the  fourth consecutive woman--elected to lead AAAS in its 149-year history.

With 143,000 members and 300 affiliated science and engineering  societies, AAAS is the world's largest general science organization. It also  publishes the prestigious weekly journal Science.

"I am honored by my election and pleased to serve AAAS in this  important role," Greenwood says. "As the broadest-based scientific  organization in the country, AAAS plays a very important role in  communicating about science funding, public education, and other issues  facing our community as we approach the 21st century."

Greenwood identifies two sets of priorities for AAAS during the next  several years. In the short term, she says, researchers must advocate for  stability and subsequent growth in the national budget for science education  and research. "It's critical for scientists to learn about the budget process  and to use every opportunity to make it clear, both to legislators and the  general public, what science has to offer to this country," Greenwood says.  Without such a unified approach, she believes, there's a danger that  scientific illiteracy will become the norm in the U.S., leaving the country  behind in terms of both the discovery of new knowledge and a citizenry  prepared for the next century.

In the longer term, Greenwood envisions AAAS as leading the charge to  regain public understanding of science and to encourage more bright young  people to pursue scientific careers. "Without strong public support, it  becomes more and more difficult to inspire the next generation of  scientists," she notes.

"In the 21st century, all of our citizens will need enhanced science,  mathematics, and technical skills," Greenwood adds. "We need to work  within the association to strengthen science education at all levels of our  schools and society, and we need to improve the accountability of the  science sector to the American taxpayer. Within the higher education  community, we need to reharmonize the disciplines and reconsider both the  graduate and the undergraduate curricula in science."

Greenwood will approach these and other issues of national science  policy from a unique dual perspective. In July 1996, President Clinton  nominated her to a six-year term on the National Science Board, a 24- member panel of leaders from academia and industry that recommends  overall policies for promoting basic research and education in the sciences.  The U.S. Senate is expected to approve Clinton's nomination of Greenwood  and four other candidates early this year.

Greenwood began her tenure as chancellor at UC Santa Cruz on July 1,  1996, following seven years at UC Davis as dean of graduate studies, with  one year also as vice provost for academic outreach. From November 1993 to  May 1995, Greenwood took a leave of absence from UC Davis to serve as  associate director for science in the White House Office of Science and  Technology Policy. There, she advised the Clinton administration on issues  related to national budgetary priorities and federal investment in  fundamental scientific research.

In her own research, Greenwood has focused upon cell biology,  genetics, physiology, and nutrition, with a particular emphasis on the  genetic causes of obesity. Her research teams have examined the complex  interplay among metabolism, development, behavior, and genetics that can  lead to obesity. In 1992, she was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the  National Academy of Sciences in recognition of her contributions.

Greenwood received her A.B. in biology from Vassar College, summa  cum laude, and her Ph.D. in physiology, developmental biology, and  neurosciences from Rockefeller University. She has held faculty positions at  Columbia University and Vassar College.
