SANTA CRUZ--The University of California, Santa Cruz, is  reorganizing its recycling program.  By June 1, it will begin placing 300 new collection bins around  campus in an effort to recycle more materials otherwise destined  for the city landfill.

A $56,000 grant from the state Department of Conservation  has provided start-up funds for UCSC to enact its Waste Diversion  Master Plan. The plan calls for bringing the university's residential  and office recycling programs under one administrative roof,  purchasing additional bins, trucks, and equipment, and increasing the  types and amount of materials collected.

As of June 1, Physical Plant will become the coordinating  office for the campus's recycling program. Currently, most of the  recycling activities on campus are divided between the Housing  Office and Physical Plant. A number of other offices also run small  recycling programs.

Since 1993, the campus's recycling rate has hovered near 20  percent, meaning that approximately one-fifth of UCSC's total  refuse is recycled. That rate meets standards set by the campus's  1988 Long Range Development Plan, says Dean Fitch, senior  superintendent at Physical Plant. However, it falls short of a current  state goal of 25 percent, which will be increased to 50 percent in  the year 2000, he says.

Implementation of the Waste Diversion Master Plan should help  the campus increase its recycling rate to 25 percent by next year,  predicts David Wade, who will become the campus's recycling  coordinator on June 1. Physical Plant is implementing the plan in  three phases over a three-year period.

With the consolidation of campus recycling activities, the  expansion of collection sites, and other efforts, Phase I should bring  waste-diversion levels up to 30 percent, Wade says.

Phase II will take place next year. As part of this phase,  Physical Plant will begin collecting glossy magazine paper and  newsprint from campus offices. It may also build a recycling center  on campus, where materials can be washed and sorted. This phase  should boost UCSC's recycling rate by an additional 8 to 12 percent. \--more--

Phase III is projected to be implemented in the 1997-98  school year. It calls for composting campus green-organic and food  wastes and should allow the campus to divert an additional 15 to 25  percent from the city landfill.
