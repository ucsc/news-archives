SANTA CRUZ, CA--Farmers are showing a growing interest in  compost, and cities are under court order to reduce the volume of  material sent to landfills. As part of a research project to explore  the viability of a partnership between farmers and municipalities,  the University of California, Santa Cruz, is sponsoring a free on- farm composting workshop on Wednesday, October 18. The workshop  will take place at the Herbert Ranch in Hollister from 10 a.m. to 1  p.m.

Workshop participants will include: Marc Buchanan, an  assistant professor of environmental studies at UCSC, who will  describe the effect of compost on plant diseases, based on his on- farm compost studies in the Monterey Bay region; UC Cooperative  Extension farm adviser Richard Smith, who will discuss his work  with local growers and what they are learning about compost's  effect on soil and plant nutrient levels; growers Phil Foster and  Brian Ziemann, who will discuss on-farm compost production and  use from their positions as an organic grower and a large-scale  conventional farm manager; and Wesley Chesbro of the California  Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB), who will give an  update on the board's efforts to encourage the use of composted  materials in agricultural operations. Pat Herbert, an organic  vegetable grower who is hosting the event, is a collaborator on the  project.

The workshop is part of a two-year project to reduce the  volume of organic materials going into landfills. Cities and counties  are working with farmers to turn these materials into a valuable  soil additive through on-farm and municipal composting. The project  is being coordinated by Buchanan; it has been funded by CIWMB.

To reach the Herbert ranch, follow Highway 156 north from  Hollister to Highway 25. Take Highway 25 two miles to McConnell  Road. Make a left onto McConnell Road, and follow signs to the Field  Day site. The event is sponsored by UCSC, the CIWMB Compost  Demonstration Project, and the Community Alliance with Family  Farmers Foundation's Lighthouse Farm Campaign.
