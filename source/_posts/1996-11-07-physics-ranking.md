title: Physics Department At UC Santa Cruz Ranks Highly In National Analysis Of Citation Rates

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Scientific papers published in the 1980s and early  1990s by physicists at UC Santa Cruz were among the most highly  regarded in the country, according to a recent study.

UCSC's Physics Department ranked seventh for the "citation  impact" of papers published between 1981 and 1994. Some analysts  view this measure--the average number of citations per paper--as  the most objective way to gauge the quality of a department's  research.

When researchers publish a journal article, they must cite  previous papers by other authors that set the stage for their work.  Generally, a paper earns more citations when scientists accept the  work as important and well done.

Physicists at Tulane University compiled the statistics and  published their results in the October 1996 issue of Physics Today.  They claimed that other methods to rank departments, such as a  major National Research Council (NRC) study released in 1995,  overlook the high-quality research often done at relatively small  universities. The NRC surveyed researchers across the country to  rank the reputations of departments in numerous disciplines.

Tulane ranked third (out of 101 physics departments) in its  own study with an average of 20.1 citations per paper. However, the  NRC survey ranked Tulane 115th (out of 147). Other departments  with large differences include those at Brandeis (sixth in the new  study, but 42nd in the NRC survey) and UCSC (seventh, 47th).

UCSC physicists published 709 papers during the study period  and earned 13,068 citations, an average of 18.4 citations per paper.  The top-ranked universities, Princeton and Harvard, received an  average of 20.7 and 20.4 citations per paper, respectively. Those  universities, and others in the top twenty, published thousands more  papers than did UCSC physicists from 1981 to 1994, leading to  greater overall influences on the field. (See table of top twenty  universities, p. 2.)

Physicists at UCSC are known for their work in theoretical and  experimental particle physics and condensed-matter physics,  astrophysics, cosmology, and nonlinear dynamics.

UCSC also has fared well in broader analyses of citation  rankings. For example, the campus placed third among U.S.  universities for the citation impact of papers published between  1981 and 1991 in all physical-science disciplines, trailing only  Harvard and Princeton.

National Research Council (NRC) rankings determined by  "reputational survey" of faculty members across the country and  published in Research-Doctorate Programs in the United States:  Continuity and Change (National Academy Press, Washington, DC,  1995). A ranking that includes a half-point (e.g., 3.5) means that two  or more institutions tied for that placement in the NRC survey.
