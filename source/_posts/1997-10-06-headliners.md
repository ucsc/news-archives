Astronomer **Dennis Zaritsky,** winner of a $500,000 fellowship from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, appeared on a KNTV evening newscast to discuss his studies of stars in two nearby galaxies. Watching the Apollo missions as a child inspired Zaritsky to enter his field, he said. The anchor stated correctly that UCSC is one of just four universities to receive at least one Packard Fellowship each year for the last four years.

The _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ looked to **Chancellor Greenwood** for comment on the recommendations of a new RAND Corporation study that concluded that California colleges and universities will have to become more efficient to cope with the coming enrollment booms.
