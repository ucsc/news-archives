## November 13 Lecture Looks At Our Understanding Of The Human Mind  By Examining Scientific Theories Of Vision

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A person born blind can tell the difference between a  sphere and a cube by touch. Were this person suddenly able to see, would she  be able to distinguish the two forms by sight? This is the crux of a puzzle  that philosophers have been debating for centuries, according to Alva Noe, an  assistant professor of philosophy at the University of California, Santa  Cruz. Noe will explore this question in connection with broader questions in  the philosophy of perception in an upcoming talk.

His talk, "Vision and the Mind," is part of the 1997-98 Humanities  Lecture Series, sponsored jointly by UCSC's Humanities Division and the  Museum of Art and History. It takes place from 7 to 8 P.M. on Thursday,  November 13, at the Museum of Art and History at the McPherson Center, 705  Front St. The talk is free and open to the public. A reception follows.

Noe will discuss theories of vision and how such theories reflect  philosophical conceptions of the nature of the mind. The talk, which will not  be technical, will ask questions about how the visual system works and will  focus on the nature of spatial vision and the relationship between vision and  action.

Noe's area of research is philosophy of the mind. His work combines  traditional philosophical methods and concerns with more recent  developments in cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Before coming to  UCSC last year, he was a research associate at Tufts University's Center for  Cognitive Studies under the direction of Daniel Dennett. During the 1995-96  academic year, he was a member of a research team at MIT's Artificial  Intelligence Laboratory working to create a conscious humanoid robot.
