## Neh Grant To UC Santa Cruz Faculty Will Fund Five-week Institute On Teaching The History Of The Environment

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz,  has received a $165,000 grant from the National Endowment for the  Humanities (NEH) to fund a five-week summer institute in 1998 to explore  the environment and world history.

Edmund Burke III, a professor of history, received the grant for the  institute, titled, "The Environment and World History, 1500-2000." The  institute will bring together 25 college and university teachers of history to  the campus next summer to discuss new approaches to incorporating the  history of the environment into world history. The seminar, Burke says,  draws upon new knowledge about the history of the environment in Europe,  Africa, Asia, and the Americas, as well as new work in world history. The  scholars will meet from June 22 to July 24, 1998.

"Despite an increasing awareness of the significance of the role of the  environment in world history," Burke says, "few world history surveys  incorporate environmental history. The goal of the institute is to develop  new understandings about the ways in which the history of the environment  and that of the modern world are inseparably linked, and to discover  strategies that will lead teachers of history and the humanities to be more  aware of the ways in which regionally based environmental histories can be  enriched and disciplined through the application of a global perspective," he  explains.

The seminar will hear presentations on topics including the history of  El Nino, as well as global patterns of deforestation, water use, the history of  environmentalism, and a variety of case studies of environmental change  from around the globe.

Burke's fields of study are Middle Eastern and world history. He has  written and edited publications on Middle Eastern social history, European  orientalism, and world history.

The NEH is an federal agency supporting research, education,  preservation projects, and public programs in the humanities.
