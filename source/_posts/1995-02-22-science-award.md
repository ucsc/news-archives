SANTA CRUZ, CA--Physicist Abraham Seiden has received the  "outstanding faculty award" for 1994-95 from his peers in the  Natural Sciences Division at UC Santa Cruz. The annual award honors  excellence in three areas: research, teaching, and service to the  campus, scientific organizations, and the public.

Seiden, a professor of physics, directs the Santa Cruz Institute  for Particle Physics (SCIPP), a leading international group in high- energy physics. SCIPP scientists work at many of the world's most  powerful particle colliders, searching for clues about the ultimate  nature of matter. Most notably, Seiden and his colleagues have  pioneered new ways to detect particles that spray outward from the  rapid-fire collisions. A unique SCIPP technology, using thousands of  small strips of silicon, was to form the core of the main detector at  the ill-fated Superconducting Super Collider. SCIPP now is helping  to adapt the technology for a future accelerator in Europe, which  will try to achieve the physics goals of the Super Collider. Seiden  also has cultivated a strong team of theorists at SCIPP, especially  in elementary particle physics and cosmology.

Seiden has served on many committees that advise on the  future of high-energy physics. For instance, he chaired the Scientific  Policy Committee at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and is  one of two Americans on the Scientific Policy Committee at CERN,  the largest particle-physics research center in Europe. At UCSC, he  has contributed to numerous committees within the Natural  Sciences Division.

Students praise Seiden for his love of teaching and for his  dedication to helping them in the laboratory. "Students . . . really  learn things that are unavailable in the literature and they get a  chance to see how one attacks problems from a fresh perspective,"  wrote David Dorfan, chairman of the Physics Department, in a letter  nominating Seiden for the award. "In the last two years he has not  received any evaluations below the top category."

Seiden earned his B.S. from Columbia University, his M.S. from  the California Institute of Technology, and his Ph.D. in physics from  UC Santa Cruz in 1974. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1976 and is a  fellow of Crown College.
