## K-12 Students Attend UCSC Summer Programs

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The dormitories at the University of California, Santa Cruz, aren't quiet this summer as hundreds of K-12 students from all over the state attend residential programs that focus on everything from youth leadership to computer technology.

Sponsored by UCSC's Educational Partnership Center, the programs are part of the campus's growing efforts to reach out to K-12 students in the post-Proposition 209 era.

"The University of California is committed to doubling the number of students who graduate from high school eligible to attend the UC campus of their choice," said center director Carrol Moran. "To do that, we've realized we need to reach out more often and more creatively to get kids thinking about higher education earlier in school. Each of our programs is designed to help us in that effort."

Residential programs are particularly valuable for K-12 students who lack the family resources to attend college. Experiencing the college environment at a young age makes an enormous impression and can help motivate students who might otherwise slip through the cracks to pursue a college education, said Moran.

One of the biggest programs this summer are five Summer Youth Leadership Conferences that are being presented by UCSC's Early Academic Outreach Program. More than 500 students are scheduled to attend the three-day conferences that are designed as a leadership development opportunity for high school students to become college information resources for their peers, serving as "UC ambassadors."

Participants attend workshops on admissions, financial aid, and academic course planning before returning to their schools to share what they've learned with their classmates. The mock college experience incudes purchasing textbooks and attending classes in astronomy, linguistics, and sociology.

Participating 10th and 11th graders hail from select schools in Salinas Union High School District and San Jose's East Side Union High School District, as well as San Benito, Santa Cruz, and North Monterey County Hgh Schools. Sessions are ongoing through August 20.

In addition to serving the campus's close regional partners, UCSC has developed two programs in connection with the UC Los Angeles Basin Initiative, which is a systemwide effort to expand the pool of students from Los Angeles County who are academically prepared to attend the university.

The Summer High School Technology and Society Institute is designed to demystify computer technologies for underserved students from Los Angeles by familiarizing them with the origins of the technology and giving them the skills to use the Internet. The program's curriculum focuses on understanding how, where, and why computer technologies are produced, as well as by whom. With an emphasis on "learning by doing," the program encourages students to use the Internet to explore these questions. The second session takes place August 16-20.

The second L.A. Basin program, "The Magical School Bus Ride," is taking students on a two-week tour of UC marine research facilities August 2-15. Students will participate in lectures, labs, field trips, and other activities related to the marine sciences.

In July, UCSC hosted another residential program geared toward providing college-going information to K-5 migrant students in the Pajaro Valley Unified School District. The two-day event, "Building a Bridge to College for Migrant Students," gave students a chance to experience college life by interacting with UCSC undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and staff. In addition, special workshops were held for parents to introduce them to the university and educate them about admissions, financial aid, and academic support services. The academic program included a computer robotics class that introduced engineering concepts and an art class that revealed the ways that art is a bridge to the world of imagination.
