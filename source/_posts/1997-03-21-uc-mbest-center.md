SAN FRANCISCO, CA--The University of California Board of Regents  voted today (March 21) to approve the initial stages of the master  plan for the UC Monterey Bay Education, Science, and Technology  (MBEST) Center, a regional economic development initiative based at  the former Fort Ord military reservation near Monterey.

The action clears the way for UC Santa Cruz, lead campus for  the MBEST Center, to begin working in earnest on development  activities that will create a community of innovative and forward-thinking researchers and educators at the site, just two  miles onshore from Monterey Bay.

The Board of Regents ratified phases one through three of the  master plan, which calls for new construction on 127 acres of UC-owned land within the City of Marina, adjacent to the Marina  Municipal Airport. Projections indicate that this development could  create between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs. The property will provide  room for about 1.3 million square feet of space for research and  development, light industry, and commercial and mixed uses.  Development is expected to last for about 15 years.

Future phases of development, not yet considered by the Board  of Regents, would occur on 357 acres of adjacent UC-owned land  within Monterey County. The MBEST site also encompasses 605 acres  of unique maritime chaparral. This land, now called the Fort Ord  Natural Reserve, is protected as part of the UC Natural Reserve  System, thereby reducing the adverse effects of development on  other MBEST property and throughout the former base.

On the developable land, MBEST planners envision a research  and technology park that will draw especially upon the strengths of  nearly two dozen research and educational institutions that freckle  the perimeter of Monterey Bay. However, the alliances and  interactions fostered by the center should extend far beyond its  physical boundaries, helping to place the Monterey Bay region in a  prime position in the 21st century's global economy.

"The MBEST Center is designed to open doors to new  partnerships in government and industry and to help create a  regional economy that will complement our teaching and research  programs," UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood told the Board of  Regents. "MBEST is part of the strategic planning for both the Santa  Cruz campus and the economy of the central California coast."

Lora Lee Martin of UCSC, director of the MBEST Center,  foresees increased interest from potential tenants now that the  Board of Regents has acted. But even without a marketing effort by  the university, about 30 companies to date have inquired about  occupying future space at the center.

"The Monterey Bay Research Crescent already is a region of  innovation and discovery," Martin said. "In the coming decades, we  will see many more new opportunities bloom here. The MBEST Center  seeks to identify and catalyze those new opportunities as the world  moves rapidly into a knowledge-based industry."

Early in their planning efforts, Martin and her colleagues  settled upon four areas of activity that would form the core of  future development at MBEST: environmental science, technology,  and instrumentation, especially coastal applications; biotechnology,  emphasizing agricultural and marine applications; information  science and technology; and multimedia education and entertainment.  Entrepreneurial companies that focus on one or more of those areas  will find eager collaborators in the region, Martin notes, as well as  in nearby Silicon Valley and throughout the UC system and its  affiliated national laboratories.

Current MBEST tenants include Systems West, a satellite  weather-technology company; UCSC Extension, which offers classes  in environmental remediation and other topics; and the Pacific  Cetacean Group, a nonprofit education and research organization.

In October, UCSC received $1 million from the Economic  Development Administration (EDA) of the U.S. Department of  Commerce to plan and construct a new building at the MBEST site.  This building, the second permanent facility at the center, should  open by late 1998.

An earlier EDA grant of $1.2 million funded the work of two  teams of consultants on the master plan; a business plan, which  recommends a functional structure and evaluates the center's short-term and long-term financial feasibility; and a market  analysis, which recommends actions for the region and the  university to attract educational and research businesses. The grant  also funded the work of MBEST staff at UCSC.
