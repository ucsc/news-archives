SANTA CRUZ, CA--Craig Reinarman, an associate professor of  sociology and a fellow of Stevenson College, has received the  Division of Social Sciences 1994 Distinguished Teaching Award. The  award, which recognizes outstanding undergraduate teaching in the  social sciences, carries with it a $500 cash prize and a "golden  apple."

"It is doubtful that anyone in the division has ever taught so  many students so well in such a wide range of courses over a five- year period of affiliation with the campus," said William Domhoff,  acting dean of the Division of Social Sciences. "And all the while,  Craig has maintained a strong record of scholarly publication."

Reinarman's undergraduate courses include Introduction to  Sociology, Sociology of Law, Drugs and Society, and Law, Crime, and  Social Justice. At the graduate level, Reinarman teaches courses on  contemporary sociological theory, social policy, and political  consciousness. He consistently teaches two or three times more  students than the campus average, and student evaluations of his  teaching are consistently enthusiastic, said Domhoff.

The annual awards were established in 1991 by former dean  Eugene Garcia to recognize faculty who are especially accomplished  undergraduate teachers in the division. Recipients are chosen by a  committee of faculty, students, and alumni.
