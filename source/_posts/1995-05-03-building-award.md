SANTA CRUZ, CA--The designers of the Earth and Marine Sciences  Building at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have received a  Merit Award in the 1995 awards program of the American Institute  of Architects, California Council.

Judges recognized two architectural firms for their work on  the building: Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership of Los Angeles  (design architects) and McLellan & Copenhagen of Cupertino  (executive architects).

"An impressive university laboratory organized around a  courtyard to form a commonality of functions," the judges  commented. "The project is handsomely detailed. The nice series of  really interesting rooms around courtyards fits in well with the  very special Santa Cruz environment."

The $29.5 million laboratory and office complex on UCSC's  "Science Hill" was occupied in the spring of 1994 and was dedicated  last November. Located just below Natural Sciences 2 and above  McHenry Library, the building houses about 175 faculty, researchers,  and graduate students in the departments of earth sciences, marine  sciences, the Institute of Tectonics, and the Institute of Marine  Sciences. The latter institute, the largest organized research unit at  UCSC, oversees the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory and includes  numerous affiliated biologists.

The building contains 142,500 gross square feet in three  separate components: a classroom wing that includes a 271-seat  lecture hall; two massive laboratory blocks; and an L-shaped office  and administration wing. Its design promotes interaction among  faculty and researchers in interrelated disciplines. The building  nestles in a forested site and includes a large landscaped central  courtyard. Portions of the four-story building overlook Monterey Bay.
