## UCSC Honors Eleven Faculty Members For Excellence In Teaching

SANTA CRUZ, CA-Each year, the Academic Senate of the University of California, Santa Cruz, honors a number of the campus's most inspirational and passionate teachers. Eleven such professors and lecturers have been chosen this year for the 1998-99 Excellence in Teaching Awards.

The award winners were nominated by students for qualities such as their enthusiasm for teaching, commitment to learning, and the content of their courses.

"Even as UCSC increases in size and expands the number of programs and courses it offers, the campus remains true to its founding vision of excellence in undergraduate teaching," said Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood.

Each award winner received a framed certificate and a $500 honorarium at a ceremony at University House the day following the spring-quarter meeting of the Academic Senate. The awards are sponsored by the senate's Committee on Teaching, which evaluated students' nomination letters, endorsement letters from department chairs, and statements on teaching from the nominees themselves in making the award determinations.

The names of this year's recipients and the wording on their certificates are:

\--Judith Aissen, linguistics, honored for a fine balance of structure and flexibility in teaching, stunning planning and organization, rigorously thorough responses to student work, and very high standards, both for students and for herself
