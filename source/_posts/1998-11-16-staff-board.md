author: UCSC Currents
---

The Staff Advisory Board has taken on new members and elected a new chair, Clare Greene of the Department of Literature. Members of the board for 1998-99 are:
* Gesna Clarke, Housing, Dining, and Child Care Services
* Peter Phillips, Physical Plant
* Joan Walker, Career Advising
* Elaine Wedegaertner, Registrar's Office
* Zaunna Wells, Conference & Summer Housing Office
* Willeen McQuitta, ex officio, Staff Human Resources Director

The Staff Advisory Board works with the Chancellor's Office to promote the interests and well-being of UCSC's staff and support the campus's mission, according to board bylaws. The board works on issues of concern to staff and traditionally sponsors a fall barbecue and spring ice-cream social for staff.

Advisory board members Phillips and Wedegaertner also represent the campus at the Council of University of California Staff Assemblies (CUCSA). Each campus in the UC system sends two staff representatives to the council's quarterly meetings.
