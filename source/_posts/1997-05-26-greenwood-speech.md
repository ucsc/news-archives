Chancellor Greenwood's Prepared Remarks  
(actual comments may vary slightly)

** UC SANTA CRUZ: FROM FIRST LIGHT TO BRIGHT FUTURE **

Thank you Regent del Junco, President Atkinson, and all those  who brought such gracious and heartfelt greetings. And my special thanks to  each of you for joining us today as we celebrate UC Santa Cruz.

Before I begin my formal remarks, I also want to express my warm gratitude  to the Inauguration Planning and Implementation Committees, those faculty,  staff, students, alumni, and community members whose planning,  organizational prowess, and sheer stamina have resulted in these inaugural  festivities. In addition, I greatly appreciate the privilege of hearing musical  fanfares composed for the occasion--and the fact that these compositions are  the work of a UCSC faculty member and a graduating student enhances my pride.

And I must express my appreciation for a few others who are here today, in  person or in fond memory. I would not be here today if it were not for my  teachers and mentors. I'm thinking of my high school science teacher Miss  Simmons, my Vassar professors, especially Margaret Wright and Elbert  Tokay, and my graduate mentor Jules Hirsch who is on the platform  today...and Ted Hullar who brought me to the UC system via a position at UC  Davis...from which many of my friends and colleagues have journeyed to join  us today.

I also might not have enjoyed the reputation that contributed to my  consideration for appointment as chancellor at this exceptional institution, if  it had not been for the dedicated and productive work of my graduate  students, undergraduate students, and postdoctoral fellows--they made every  day worthwhile! There are too many to mention them all, but I am  particularly proud to say that several of them are here today, wearing the  robes of their own academic institutions...including my colleagues Ruth Kava  and David West.

Most importantly, I am grateful to my family--my son, daughter-in-law,  granddaughter, my sisters and their families--and my many very dear  friends. They have given me sustaining support and strength and limitless  patience--and I could not hope to manage without their love.

The time to adjourn to a less formal setting to complete our celebration is  near. Glancing at my watch, I am reminded of the adage: "In  order for a speech to be immortal, it need not be eternal." So, enough  thanks--which truly are endless...

I am grateful, and I am very proud to have the great honor of serving as the  seventh chancellor of  UC Santa Cruz. As I approached this day, it made me reflect  on the past and excited me for the future. Let me share some of these  thoughts with you.

Fiat Lux! Let there be light!

With this motto, in the last quarter of the 19th century, in a language many  students today do not recognize, the greatest public university in the world  was created.

On the 98th anniversary of the founding of the University of California, one  of it's last children was born. The University of California, Santa Cruz, was  conceived as an experimental campus, a new model. It was seen as the result  of the union of the exceptional humanizing experiences and interaction found  in small liberal arts colleges and the college-based structure of universities  such as Oxford and Yale, with the intensity and breadth of a comprehensive  research university. Even with uncommon attention to undergraduate  education, the new campus was planned to offer, in time, a full complement  of professional schools.

Only 30 years have passed, with progressive implementation of the original  concept. Nonetheless, a remarkable legend has evolved.

When UC Santa Cruz was born, it was an era of national turmoil, a time whose  motto was "Question Authority," and the fervor of the counterculture  movement was at its peak. Like the young adults of the 60s, who now people  the UC Santa Cruz faculty and its administration and who are the parents or  grandparents of our undergraduate students today, UC Santa Cruz was  irreverent, skeptical, unafraid of new ideas and more than occasionally  chaotic in appearance to the outside world. Now, like our remarkable alumni  of those founding years, UC Santa Cruz has grown to be a source of great  pride for the founders and for the community.

By deliberate intent, UC Santa Cruz always has fostered an unusual  creativity, as the achievements of our faculty, staff, and students give  testimony. Examples abound. Among our alumni, we count astronauts, who  step literally into the unknown with audacious confidence. You just heard  Kathy Sullivan speak, and there is Astronaut Steven Hawley, who recently  walked in space to adjust the Hubble Telescope, itself a work of genius to  which UC Santa Cruz faculty contributed significantly. We see that  characteristic leading-edge intellect also in contemporary chroniclers, such as  Pulitzer prize winners Laurie Garrett, who brilliantly focused our attention  on the coming plagues, and photographer Annie Wells, who visually captured  the drama of a natural disaster. As I travel throughout the state and across  the nation, I meet teachers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, corporate leaders,  parents and politicians who make a difference in their communities and in  the lives of others. As individuals they are remarkably different, but they  speak of their UC Santa Cruz experience with a common passion.

Our faculty too, are bold and inquisitive. By deliberate  intent, our scientists  concentrate much of their efforts on the true frontiers of contemporary  science--the universe, the oceans, the environment, new materials, and the  most fundamental work in the understanding of our genes and our very  being. Our humanists have led the way in serious interdisciplinary work with  internationally known programs, such as those in women's studies, the  history of human consciousness, literature, philosophy, and linguistics. Our  performing and visual artists are renowned for their experimentation with  global methods and themes. Their achievement attracts international notice  and results in the gift of archives of great artists, such as the  composer/musician Lou Harrison. Our social scientists cultivate a broad  perspective, addressing some of the most tenacious problems facing society  today, like international monetary issues, education, conflict resolution, new  methods of agriculture, health and welfare reform and the contemporary  understanding of primates and their relationship to Homo sapiens.

To augment this array of talent, we now approach the 21st century with an  unparalleled opportunity to build the first University of California  engineering school of this new century! Once again UC Santa Cruz has a  chance to demonstrate its intrepid spirit.

The "Santa Cruz experiment" has proven resilient, and our campus is one of  the few successfully established research universities of the post-World War  II era. UC Santa Cruz now is recognized as one of the rising challengers in the  nation, recently ranked overall as number 15 among U.S. public research  universities. We are often the only public research university mentioned in  popular surveys for excellence in undergraduate teaching.

Fiat Lux! Let there be light! Fiat Flux! Let there be change! Is UC Santa Cruz  the same as 30 years ago? Certainly not! What 30-year-old is unchanged?  Institutions, like individuals, grow, adapt, and are shaped by the  circumstances in which they find themselves. Yes, we must strive always to  honor our roots, but we must also ensure that we do not become root bound.  Rather, we must remain at once adaptable and resilient.

It is frequently asserted that the  university is our faculty, and it is true that  much of the perceived quality of a university is a direct reflection of the  luster of faculty accomplishments. However, as faculty our common purpose  is to inspire and educate the future leaders of the state and the nation. We do  this by sharing knowledge and by creating knowledge. It is this community  of educators and learners that closely approximates the original definition of  our Latin root _universitas,_ which means "whole" or "body."

In addition to the pursuit and creation of knowledge, the daily work of the  university mirrors that of any large enterprise. We feed thousands of people,  transport as many, pay our employees and our vendors. We design, build,  maintain, counsel, schedule, organize, and communicate. And we safeguard  this most lovely of the nation's campuses. It is our devoted staff who in a  very real way are the infrastructure that makes it possible for our professors  to teach and create and for our students to learn.

The UC Santa Cruz enterprise is synergistic, and the results of our efforts are  greater than the individual parts. In the language of a  logician, faculty, staff, and students are necessary for the  university to exist, but individually, they  are not sufficient.

Fiat Lux! Fiat Flux!! Change is no more evident than in circumstances and  experiences of our students. For example, compared to the entering students  in the '60s, today's UC Santa Cruz students are from the most diverse  population in California's history, and many of them face increasingly  difficult financial circumstances. The average student leaves college  substantially in debt and has worked on average many more hours than her  or his counterpart only two or three decades ago. Sadly, the most frequent  reason students leave the university is not lack of motivation or lack of  ability, but financial need.

And yet, our students do a stunning amount of volunteer work, on campus  and in the greater community. At a recent United Way event, I was told that  there was not a single volunteer organization in Santa Cruz County that could  operate at its present level without the volunteer time that UC Santa Cruz  students contribute.

This willingness to serve also is manifest in the fact that UC Santa  Cruz, one of  the smallest of the UC campuses, also has the greatest numbers of students  entering the Peace Corps. A propensity for wide horizons also is evident by  the fact that we are the UC campus with the largest percentage of students  who study abroad.

And so, the legend of UC Santa Cruz becomes the legacy for the future. UC  Santa Cruz is no dream, it is no myth, it is no longer an experiment. Seasoned  and matured, UC Santa Cruz now gazes through the portal to a new century, a  period in which we will expand the fruitful partnerships that will link us,  both within and without, in ways that will only enhance our strengths.

By now, you may have accurately concluded that I am an optimist. But let me  caution that I do not believe that the road ahead has no hazards. Not at all.  Like most contemporary traditional institutions, UC Santa Cruz, or for that  matter the entire University of California, has its  challengers and its critics.  We must work together to strengthen the public trust and to ensure that the  greatest public research university in the world is not diminished by  innuendo or inadequate understanding of our true contributions.

One of our continuing challenges will continue to be the erosion of state and  federal support. We no longer can define ourselves as a state-supported  university; now we are state-assisted universities--and, unless there is  change, soon we may be forced to call ourselves state-located universities.

I hope this worst case remains a laughable notion, but to sustain ourselves  we must boldly develop new resources and favorable partnerships.

The nation has long had a "compact" with our research universities to  produce new knowledge, products, and processes, and thus our faculty are  held to high standards of competitive scholarship. Today, their fundamental  work is considered the cornerstone of the 21st century economic  development and global competitiveness. For UC Santa Cruz, this role will not  diminish. In fact, to it will be added responsibilities for  generating the scholarship that will foster  environmental security, personal security, conflict  resolution, and the development of new common values.

In addition, UC Santa Cruz must continue to be a good citizen, to share our  resources with our communities and to demonstrate the model of the 21st  century "knowledge and creativity center."

Although I have been here a mere 10 months and 23 days, I can clearly see  that UC Santa Cruz is the right institution in the right place for the next  century. Some have called the period ahead the "age of creativity" or the "age  of imagination." For us to capitalize on this new renaissance, this new age of  enlightenment, we will have to use our collective wits and reach across  disciplinary boundaries. We will have to be pioneers, pushing to new  frontiers, reinterpreting the past, and reinventing the future. Fortunately,  creative energy abounds here!

As a simple example: It is plain, right now at UC Santa Cruz, that the faculty  of the arts and the engineering sciences together are seizing an  unprecedented opportunity to combine the tools of engineers and scientists  with the fresh images and sounds of artists to ignite the imagination of the  coming generation--and the multimedia field will only grow!

UC Santa Cruz is leading the way. We can, however, do even more--and we  will. We'll begin with the establishment of the campus's Millennium  Committee. This visionary group will work next year to distill our essence, to  provide the best advice for our future directions, and to define the standards  by which we and others will measure our success. The committee's process  will be inclusive and will gather input not only from our own faculty,  students, staff, and partners but will also look outward  and listen carefully to  a variety of sages, critics, and provocateurs.

Moreover, we will strengthen the best aspects of our undergraduate  education, examine the problems and solidify our position as the best  research university in the country in which to gain a baccalaureate degree.  At the same time, we will continue to develop an array of distinctive  graduate and professional programs and research centers that typify the rich  new intellectual opportunities of the impending century.

Let us begin today by reaffirming our shared basic principles, our root  values.

First, we must always be a place where the irreverent can thrive, where  creative ideas can play, where the canons are challenged, and where the  controversial is openly discussed without rancor.

Second, we must maintain and model civility and mutual respect. It is not  possible to have the first without the last. We cannot be controversial and  uncivil at the same time, if we truly strive for enlightenment.

Third, we must maintain our personal and institutional integrity and  honesty. We must agree to trust each other--and we must deserve that trust.

In brief, we must seek first to understand and then to be understood. This  behavior is the hallmark of the best professors and also of the best  students--and it is the sign of the best leaders.

By reaffirming these root values, we state clearly that we are now as we  began, a beacon of light shining into the next century. We reaffirm our  institution, UC Santa Cruz. We understand that education is our mission but  the foundation of an education is knowledge. To be a great university is to  both create knowledge and to transmit and preserve this knowledge.

For our students and our partners, knowledge is power.

Not knowledge to be used to control or intimidate, but knowledge that  liberates the spirit and the mind...knowledge that leads us out of the  darkness and into the full light of wisdom and understanding... knowledge  that leads to personal fulfillment and an enlightened society.

This is the true definition of our motto. FIAT LUX. In more contemporary  languages, in English, LET THERE BE LIGHT;  in Spanish, SEA HECHA LA LUZ;  in Russian, DA BUDYET SVYET.

Let there be light. Let us enlighten.  Let us ensure that our light is never hidden or extinguished. And now, my colleagues and friends, I pledge to you that I will do my very  best to enable UC Santa Cruz to move successfully and creatively into the  21st century, and I ask for your help and support.

FIAT LUX!

FIAT SLUGS!
