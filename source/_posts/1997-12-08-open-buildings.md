In addition to the scheduled 1997-98 holidays (December 25, 26, and 31 and January 1) and weekend days (December 27 and 28 and January 3 and 4) much of the campus will be shut down on December 29 and 30 and January 2\. For safety reasons, police and fire units will be on duty throughout the shutdown period. In case of emergency, call the campus emergency number, 911\. Minimal custodial service will be provided for those facilities that remain open. Building and utility services personnel will be on standby.

The following campus units have arranged to be open and/or have limited staff available during all or part of the shutdown. Except where noted, these arrangements cover the nonholiday weekdays (December 29 and 30 and January 2) during the shutdown period. For security reasons, buildings will not be routinely unlocked. Therefore, faculty and staff will need building keys or must make special arrangements to ensure access to their building.

* The **ARBORETUM** will be open, except for Christmas Day. **NORRIE'S** at the Arboretum will be closed from December 25 through January 1.
* The **BAY TREE BOOKSTORE** will be staffed to unload, price, and shelve textbooks. It will not be open for sales during the break.
* **COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY SERVICES** will provide limited computer support services; please report campus network problems on the special message phone, (408) 459-3798. Telephone service during this period will be the same as the campus normally provides on weekends and holidays. For details about these and other CATS services, see the CATS  [ Web site][2].

The whole community is invited to visit Long Marine Lab courtesy of their excellent volunteer docents who will show visitors around and answer questions about UCSC's marine research, animals and facilities, and the marine environment.
* **MAIL SERVICES** (Applied Sciences) will have limited staffing to sort incoming mail, with no campus deliveries scheduled.

* **UNIVERSITY ADVANCEMENT** will be open with limited staffing to serve year-end donors from 8 a.m. to noon and 1 to 5 p.m. on December 26, 29, and 30 and from 8 a.m. to noon on December 31.

At every college, utilities will be provided to residence halls, apartments, guest suites, faculty apartments, and college houses.

All campus units closing during this shutdown period are urged to make sure that computing equipment and refrigerators are shut down for maximum energy savings. If disposing of food from refrigerators, please place it in dumpsters to avoid pests and spoiled food in buildings. If you are working during the closure, please be sure to turn off lights, computers, and other electrical equipment upon leaving the area. Also, make sure doors are locked when you leave. To avoid fire hazard risks, please do not use electric space heaters during the shutdown.

Please note that buildings tend to take a significantly longer time to warm up after a shutdown even though the heating systems are on. You are encouraged to dress warmly when working in buildings that have been closed. The Heat Plant requests your cooperation and patience during the first week of January as buildings are brought back to their normal temperatures.
