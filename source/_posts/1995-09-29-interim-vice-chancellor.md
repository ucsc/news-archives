SANTA CRUZ, CA---James F. Sullivan, a veteran University of  California administrator, will serve as interim vice chancellor of  Business and Administrative Services at UC Santa Cruz, effective  immediately. Sullivan replaces L. Edwin Coate, who is leaving the  vice chancellor's position to become vice president of business  services at Mira Costa College in San Diego County.

Executive Vice Chancellor R. Michael Tanner, who announced  Sullivan's appointment today, said a search will commence this fall  to fill the position on a permanent basis. "We are fortunate to have  the services of James Sullivan," Tanner said. "He brings seasoned  leadership and extensive experience in all aspects of university  business and administrative services."

Sullivan most recently served as vice chancellor for  administration at UC's Davis campus. In addition to filling that post  during his years at UCD (1978-91), Sullivan also served as dean of  University Extension and director of organized public service.

Sullivan began his UC career at the Riverside campus in 1966.  In 1966-67, he served as assistant to the chancellor, coordinating  academic, physical, and fiscal planning for the campus. He became  vice chancellor for business and finance in 1969. From 1974 to  1978, he was associate professor in UCR's Graduate School of  Administration and served as associate director of the campus's Dry  Lands Research Institute. Sullivan also was chair of the Academic  Senate Committee on Academic Planning and Budgeting for two  years.

Before working for the University of California, Sullivan was  an assistant professor in the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate  School of Public and International Affairs.

Since 1991, Sullivan has worked as a consultant and has  written articles, including one entitled "Ethics in the Workplace." It  was published this past spring in the newsletter Management  Issues by the consulting firm Peat Marwick. He also coauthored a  chapter on new revenue sources for colleges and universities in the  book Reinventing the University, published this year.

Sullivan earned a bachelor's degree in government from  Dartmouth College, a master's in public administration from the  University of Colorado, and a Ph.D. in political science from the  University of Pittsburgh.
