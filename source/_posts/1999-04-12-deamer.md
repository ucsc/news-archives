## "Membranes, Martians, And Meteorites" Lecture At UCSC April 17

SANTA CRUZ, CA--David Deamer, professor emeritus of chemistry at UC Santa Cruz, will give a free public lecture entitled "Membranes, Martians, and Meteorites" on Saturday, April 17, from 2 to 4 p.m. in Room B206, Earth and Marine Sciences Building, on the UCSC campus. Deamer will discuss current ideas about how life began on earth and what we know about possible life elsewhere in the solar system.

Deamer's research, funded by NASA, concerns the role of membranes in the evolutionary events leading up to the origin of cellular life. His findings have been featured in numerous television documentaries and national magazines.

The talk, held in conjunction with UCSC's Banana Slug Spring Fair, kicks off the first alumni reunion for the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. A catered reception will be held afterward.
