![\[Photocopy of identity card issued by the Nazis\]][1] After Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933, the Nazis issued every person a permanent identity card. A "J" on the cover indicated that the person was Jewish. Each Jewish man's name was prefaced with "Israel" and each woman's name with "Sarah." Permanent yellow armbands were issued at a later time. Card courtesy of the Neufeld Family Archive, a collection of Holocaust and family artifacts donated by Anne Neufeld Levin. The collection is housed at Special Collections in UCSC's McHenry Library.

A conference on film and the Holocaust takes place Wednesday, April 22, through Thursday, April 23, at UCSC. The conference coincides with Yom Hashoah--the international day of remembrance for victims of the Holocaust.

Leading Holocaust and film scholars from around the country will convene for the conference, titled "Film and the Holocaust: A Conversation," to discuss representations of the Holocaust in film. A keynote speech, "Images of Jews and the Holocaust in Film," will be presented at 7:30 p.m. on April 22 in Kresge 321 by Sharon Rivo, director of the National Center for Jewish Film at Brandeis University. The conference continues at Stevenson College at 9 a.m. on April 23.

In the days leading up to the conference, films related to the Holocaust will be screened at UCSC. Films will be shown at 7 p.m. April 18-21 at Kresge College. All events are free and open to the public. The conference is made possible through support from the Neufeld-Levin Chair in Holocaust Studies.
