SANTA CRUZ, CA--Compost piles can be magical or mystifying. When made  correctly, they heat up and decompose into a dark, crumbly, woodsy-smelling  soil amendment. But when they don't work, you're left with a heap of  ingredients that refuse to break down.

If you've ever tried and failed, or if you'd like to perfect your  composting skills, or if you're just curious about the benefits of compost,  mark your calendar for Saturday, November 9, when compost experts from  the UC Santa Cruz Farm will share their tips.

The workshop, which will run from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. at the UCSC Farm,  will cover how to choose the proper mix and proportion of ingredients, how  to troubleshoot a balky pile, and how to find the best applications for your  finished product. A short session on worm-box composting, or vermiculture,  will finish off the day.

Cost of the workshop is $10, payable the day of the event. Wear clothes  that can get dirty, and bring a lunch. The Farm is located 1/4 mile up the  gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available  across the street from the Blacksmith Shop in the Campus Facilities parking  lot.

For more information, call (408) 459-3240. The workshop is sponsored  by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems and the Friends  of the UCSC Farm and Garden.
