SANTA CRUZ, CA--From the upset victory of Democrat Loretta Sanchez over  incumbent Republican Congressman Robert Dornan in Orange County to the  passage of Proposition 209, Latinos had a lot at stake in the 1996 elections.  The Chicano/Latino Research Center at UC Santa Cruz is hosting a panel  discussion entitled "Lessons from the 1996 Elections for Latino Politics," on  Friday, February 14, from 2 to 5 P.M. in the Baobab Lounge at Merrill College  on the UCSC campus. The event is free and open to the public.

Panelists are Monica Lozano, editor and publisher of La Opinion, the  largest Spanish-language newspaper in the United States; David Ayon,  researcher with the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount  University; and Luis Fraga, associate professor of political science at  Stanford University. Pedro Castillo, associate professor of history at UCSC,  and Anna Sampaio, lecturer in politics at UCSC, will participate in the  discussion, which will be moderated by Jonathan Fox, associate professor of  Latin American and Latino studies at UCSC.

"Latino voter registration and turnout rose dramatically at the state  and national level, particularly in California," says Fox. "This diverse group  of political observers will analyze what this increasing Latino participation  means for state and national politics."

In addition to Proposition 209 and the Orange County race, panelists  will discuss the role of Latinos in the second Clinton administration.

The discussion is cosponsored by UCSC's Chicano/Latino Research  Center, the politics department, the history department, Casa Latina, Latin  American and Latino studies, and Merrill College. For more information, call  (408) 459-3789.
