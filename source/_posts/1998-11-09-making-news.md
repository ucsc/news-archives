An article in _New Scientist_ magazine about Earth's inner core featured several UCSC earth scientists, including Professor **Elise Knittle,** Professor and Chair of earth sciences **Thorne Lay,** Associate Professor **Justin Revenaugh,** and Associate Professor **Quentin Williams.**

The story of the deaths of founding faculty member **Page Smith **and his wife, Santa Cruz artist **Eloise Pickard Smith,** was featured on a segment of NPR's _This American Life._ Titled, "Last Words," the show looked at people's last thoughts and ideas before death. The Smiths were married for more than five decades, and died a day apart. **John Dizikes,** a longtime friend and colleague of Page Smith's, was interviewed for the segment. One listener described the show as compelling, the kind you have to pull your car over for.

**Stan Woosley,** professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics, was quoted in an Associated Press article about new findings linking supernovae and gamma ray bursts.

Forensic anthropologist **Alison Galloway**'s testimony in a murder case was covered by the Bakersfield _Californian._ Galloway has analyzed the remains of the victim, whose cause of death is disputed.

Astronomer **Steven Vogt** was quoted in _Science_ magazine's "NetWatch" column, commenting on a Web site for planet hunters (the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia, maintained by the Paris Observatory).

Retired conservation biologist **Michael Soul√©** was quoted in a _San Jose Mercury News_ story about a $35 million donation by Intel cofounder Gordon Moore and his wife. The donation will help create a center dedicated to anticipating--and preventing--threats to the world's most biologically rich habitats. . . . Also in the _Mercury News_ was a quote from **Mike Rotkin** in a story about then-San Jose mayoral candidate Ron Gonzales (He won.). Rotkin knew Gonzales when the candidate was an undergraduate at UCSC.
