SANTA CRUZ, CA--Recent stories and photos of Russian soldiers  battling in the country's southeastern borderlands are nothing  unusual. Preceding the bloody conflict now raging in Grozny,  Chechnya, was the war in neighboring Azerbaijan. In both cases,  native Islamic populations have fought against more than 100 years  of domination imposed by a country with drastically different  cultural and religious practices.

Dmitri Mikulsky, a leading expert on Islam and Islamic culture  in the former Soviet Union, will explore the roots of such conflicts  in a talk titled "Islam in the Social and Cultural Context of the  Former Soviet Union." The talk takes place from 4 to 6 p.m. on  Thursday, January 26, at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in  the Merrill Baobab Lounge. A discussion will follow.

Mikulsky is a senior research fellow at the Institute for the  Study of Religion at the Academy of Social Science in Moscow. He  has made a lifelong study of the ethnic, cultural, and religious  history of Islamic people living on the borderlands of the Russian  Federation. Among his publications are several books on Islamic and  Muslim thought and culture as well as more than 30 articles on  Islam, Arab-Islamic history, and Arabic literature.

His talk is sponsored by UCSC's Humanities Division. For more  information, call (408) 459-2696.
