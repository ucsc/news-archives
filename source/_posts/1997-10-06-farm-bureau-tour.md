About a dozen members of the Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau toured the UCSC Farm with Chancellor Greenwood and other campus officials last Tuesday. The tour gave Farm Bureau members an opportunity to see and hear about the latest activities of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems and to meet its new director, Carol Shennan, a professor of environmental studies who just joined the UCSC faculty from UC Davis.

Center staff and faculty have helped pioneer cooperative, on-farm research with regional organic and conventional farmers of strawberries, apples, artichokes, and vegetable row crops. Shennan expressed her interest in continuing to build such collaborations with growers in the future.

Shortly after her arrival in Santa Cruz last year, Chancellor Greenwood toured several local farming operations as a guest of the Farm Bureau.
