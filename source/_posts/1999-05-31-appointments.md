**Beau Willis** has been chosen as the assistant dean for the Division of Natural Sciences. Willis was unanimously recommended for the position by the selection committee. He replaces Dennis Artman, who retired last summer.

Willis brings to the position a broad perspective gained from years at UCSC in student, academic, and staff roles. He completed both his undergraduate and graduate degrees in chemistry at UCSC. He has experience in both industry and the university as a research scientist. Willis has taught university courses, and he was appointed manager of the Chemistry Instructional Laboratories in 1994.

In September of 1997, Willis was appointed acting assistant dean of natural sciences. In this role, "He has made significant contributions. . . . He is an excellent representative for the Division of Natural Sciences and has brought renewed focus and energy to divisional efforts in the areas of outreach, strategic planning, and budget initiatives," said natural sciences dean David Kliger. "Beau's commitment to the campus, coupled with his science background and experience, will serve us well as we move forward into a time of growth and new opportunities. "
