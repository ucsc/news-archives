Back by popular demand: Because of listener response to shows this fall, the Australian Broadcast Company invited linguist **Geoffrey Pullum** back to its show, _Lingua Franca,_ to discuss grammar in general and the changing grammar of Australian English specifically.

The _Register-Pajaronian_ ran an article about UCSC's **Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics,** which was ranked second in the nation in an independent survey. Professor and chair of the department **Stan Woosley** was quoted in the article.

Theater arts professor **Mel Wong** is a man of many talents. A current exhibition of his acrylic paintings and sculpture is on display at the Porter Faculty gallery through January 10. The exhibit was profiled in a complimentary review in _Metro Santa Cruz._

Psychology's **Donald Saposnek** appeared on KUSP Radio's noon broadcast of _Prime Time_ to discuss youth and violence in schools. He presented the latest research on the differences between the youths committing the new suburban shootings in schools and those who commit more traditional urban violence, and he discussed the psychological and sociological factors that contribute to such violence.
