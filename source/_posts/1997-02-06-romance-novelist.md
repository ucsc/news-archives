SANTA CRUZ, CA--A best-selling romance novelist has made a gift to the  University of California, Santa Cruz--her alma mater--to establish an  important library endowment.

The endowment comes from Jayne Ann Krentz, whose contribution of  $10,000 has established the Castle Humanities Fund. Interest from the fund,  established in Krentz's maiden name, makes it possible for the library to  acquire books in the humanities that it would not be able to purchase  otherwise.

"I valued learning in a climate in which the humanities were well- respected," said Krentz. "I hope that my gift helps engender in future  students the same love of humanities that I gained at UCSC."

Krentz graduated from UCSC's Stevenson College in 1970 with a B.A. in  history. One of the country's most popular romance novelists, Krentz has  published more than 50 contemporary and historical romances, with 20  consecutive New York Times best-sellers to her credit (many published  under the pen name of Amanda Quick). Along with her work in contemporary  and historical romance, Krentz is the author of an important critical volume,  Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women: Romance Writers on the Appeal of  the Romance. The book received the Susan Koppelman Award for feminist  studies from the Women's Caucus of the Popular Culture Association and the  American Culture Association.

At the same time that she made this gift to the University Library,  Krentz also made contributions to several elementary school libraries in  Seattle, where she lives. "Books are so important at those two ends of the  spectrum," she explained. "For children to learn to love books they need to be  exposed to them at an early age, and for students to thrive in college they  need to have access to as diverse a range of materials as possible."

Before she began her writing career full-time, Krentz earned an M.A. in  library science from San Jose State University and worked for a number of  years in corporate and academic libraries, including the Duke University  library. As a former librarian, Krentz noted, she is quite aware of the  changing needs of a library and of the high degree of planning and research  that goes into making new acquisitions. Because of her insider's  perspective, she stipulated that her gift be unrestricted-- meaning that  campus librarians may make acquisitions in the areas they deem most  suitable for the library.

"We are thrilled Ms. Krentz has chosen to give back to UCSC through  enriching the humanities materials in the library," said University Librarian  Allan Dyson. "The unrestricted nature of the gift is especially welcome--it  will help the largest number of students and faculty who will be using our  humanities collections."
