**Nearby Dwarf Galaxy In Sagittarius Yields Rare Opportunity To Study A  Strong Tidal Interaction In Detail**

TUCSON, AZ--Dwarf galaxies spiraling into the gravitational maw of  the Milky Way should leave visible trails of debris that persist for a  billion years or more, according to new computer simulations by  three astrophysicists.

Astronomers could learn much about the evolution of the Milky  Way by finding these faint remains, say the creators of the  simulations. Many such trails would bolster a theory that the Milky  Way formed and continues to grow by capturing smaller galaxies and  subsuming their stars, gases, and dark matter. On the other hand, an  absence of trails might mean that our galaxy's appetite for stellar  hors d'oeuvres is lower than many astronomers believe.

"When the Milky Way disrupts a dwarf galaxy, it takes some  time for its stars to disperse," says Kathryn Johnston, a graduate  student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "We think that  observations of these moving groups of stars are feasible. If they  exist, they will offer an exciting window on the history of the  galaxy."

Johnston discussed the research today (January 10) in a poster  session at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Her  coworkers were David Spergel, associate professor of astronomy at  Princeton University, and Lars Hernquist, associate professor of  astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.

The simulations examine the fate of a dwarf galaxy observed  in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. Astronomers from  the University of Cambridge unveiled the dwarf last year beyond the  Milky Way's dusty and crowded core; it is the closest known galaxy  to our own. Its stretched shape suggests that the Milky Way is  ripping it asunder, just as the gravitational tides of Jupiter broke  apart comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. However, researchers do not yet  know whether the dwarf is encountering the Milky Way for the first  time or is in its death throes following many orbits.

Johnston, Spergel, and Hernquist realized that computer  simulations were ideal for exploring the possible history of the  dwarf. The team used techniques developed by Hernquist and others  for modeling collisions between galaxies--spectacular events in  which gravity flings enormous arcs of stars into space.

The team's most detailed model depicted the Sagittarius dwarf  as a loose conglomeration of 5 million particles. A complex  computer code calculated the results as the particles interacted  with each other and with three components of the Milky Way: a  central bulge, a saucer-shaped disk, and an extended halo of diffuse  material harboring most of the Milky Way's mass. Dozens of hours of  computer time were required to trace the dwarf through six orbits  around the Milky Way--a process that would take about 13 billion  years in the real universe.

The researchers found that when the dwarf passed near or  through the disk of the Milky Way, its stars received a shock of  energy. Here's why: Stars in the Milky Way invaded the boundaries of  the dwarf each time it moved past. Those stars briefly increased the  mass of the dwarf, squeezing it because of the additional  gravitational force. When the dwarf left the disk, its stars  rebounded and partially flew apart. Each passage thus created  streamers of stars in distinct paths, both ahead of and behind the  dwarf. (See attached diagram.) Meanwhile, a core of stars stayed  closely packed together, even a billion years after the complete  destruction of the dwarf.

Debris from these passages should be visible in the sky as  groups of stars moving in the same direction, the simulations  indicate. However, astronomers would need to conduct careful  surveys of large swaths of sky to find the moving groups. Previous  studies have shown that the Milky Way's coterie of dwarf galaxies-- nine in all--appears to lie along two great circles around our galaxy.  "Those paths are logical places to look for evidence of previous  encounters," Johnston suggests. Surveys could expose the remnants  of a previous passage of the Sagittarius dwarf itself, or of  encounters with other dwarfs during the last billion years.

Astronomers disagree over whether the Milky Way once hosted  a much greater swarm of dwarf galaxies and other satellites.  Johnston, Spergel, and Hernquist believe that the mere existence of  the Sagittarius dwarf supports the view that the Milky Way gorges  regularly on neighbors. The dwarf's close encounter now in progress,  they observe, will last about 100 million years--less than 1 percent  of the galaxy's age. "Clearly, accretions of dwarf galaxies must be  common," they write, "or we must instead conclude that we are  observing the galaxy during a special phase of its evolution." The  latter alternative, they maintain, is unlikely.

The team's results also reveal that the Milky Way's halo of  dark matter can disrupt dwarf galaxies just as readily as its disk of  stars. As a result, many dwarfs need never approach the disk to  disperse into unaffiliated stars. Some researchers claim that the  Milky Way could not have consumed many small galaxies over time,  because its disk appears too thin and undisturbed. However, the  simulations show that the Milky Way could absorb a huge amount of  material in small encounters--up to 10 billion times the mass of our  sun--while still keeping a thin disk.

For its study, the team used the Connection Machine 5 (CM-5)  at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in Illinois.  The CM-5, consisting of 512 computers running in parallel, is among  the fastest machines available for this type of research. The project  was part of the GC3 collaboration, a High-Performance Computing  and Communications (HPCC) initiative funded by the National Science  Foundation. The GC3 group includes scientists at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, Princeton University, University of Illinois,  University of Indiana, University of Pittsburgh, and UC Santa Cruz.
