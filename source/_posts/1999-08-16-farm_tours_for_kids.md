## UC Santa Cruz Farm Needs Volunteers To Lead Tours For Kids

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The UC Santa Cruz Farm & Garden needs people with an interest in gardening and working with kids to volunteer as tour guides for small groups of schoolchildren.

Volunteers lead groups of children in grades second through sixth on interactive tours of the Farm's fields, garden, orchards, and beehives. They also pitch in and help with garden projects in the new Children's Garden.

Volunteers are asked to lead one tour per week and must be available to lead tours that take place on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays from 9:30 to 12 p.m.

A half-day orientation and training will take place on September 1 from 1:00 to 4:30 p.m. at the UCSC Farm. Participants are expected to observe one tour before conducting their own. A manual will be provided.
