Just in time for the holidays, the UCSC Arboretum is holding its annual Dried Flower and Succulent Sale on Saturday and Sunday, November 14 and 15, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. both days. Exotic dried arrangements, rare and unusual succulent plants, protea wreaths, and materials for making your own gifts are among the offerings at this year's sale. The sale will be held in the Horticulture II Building at the Arboretum, located on Empire Grade between the east and west entrances to campus.

Dried flowers and foliages will be available singly, by the bunch, and in arrangements. Many different kinds of wreaths will be available, some featuring unusual cones and spiral shapes from plants in the protea family and others made of colorful dried perennials and herbs. The Arboretum's extensive collections of South African and Australian plants provide a variety of unusual dried plant materials for use in wreaths and arrangements.

There will also be living wreaths planted with succulents that will last three to four years. Dish gardens, landscaping plants, cacti, and gift books round out the selections.

A new succulent shrub for the United States, _Hakea clavata,_ will be sold for the first time at this event. It is one of the few members of the protea family with succulent leaves. It has light pink, spidery flowers reminiscent of grevillea flowers. Some of the Arboretum's other new plant introductions will be available too.

The Dried Flower and Succulent Sale is an all-volunteer effort featuring materials grown at the Arboretum or donated by volunteers. All proceeds benefit the Arboretum.

The UCSC Arboretum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (except Thanksgiving and Christmas). The Arboretum gift shop, Norrie's Gifts, has a wide selection of vases for dried and fresh flowers, including a new display of Ikebana containers. Norrie's is open Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sundays, 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.
