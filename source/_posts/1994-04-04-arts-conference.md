SANTA CRUZ--Art departments at colleges and universities around  the country are in crisis as faculty and students grapple with  questions of cultural diversity and technological innovation. The Art  Board at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is hosting a two- day conference April 21-22 to foster discussion among educators,  artists, activists, and students.

Titled "Target 2000: Rethinking the Future in Art Education,"  the conference is designed to be an open forum for artists and  educators. "The question is how do we develop a curriculum that's  more multicultural, technologically improved, and interdisciplinary,"  says conference organizer Norman Locks, an assistant professor of  art at UCSC. "How much diversity can a program take philosophically  before it becomes too fragmented and loses its integrity?"

Artists today bring aspects of non-Western cultures into their  work, and technological innovations have created whole new art  forms, such as computer-assisted photography and mixed media,  says art professor Joyce Brodsky. "It is causing great waves in arts  education," she says. "As we design an art program that is based on  traditional practices such as painting, sculpture, and printmaking,  how do we accommodate the experiences of students from diverse  backgrounds? How much of the new technology do we include?"

The questions have become an ideological battleground, and  organizers of the conference have invited panelists who represent  all sides of the debate. Among the participants are Malaquias  Montoya, a well-known muralist from UC Davis; Carol Becker, dean  of academic affairs at the Art Institute of Chicago; Anne Healy,  chair of the studio art department at UC Berkeley; and Edgar Heap of  Birds, a Native American painter from the University of Oklahoma.

The conference, which takes place in the Performing Arts  Theater at UCSC, begins at 8:30 a.m. on April 21 with a panel  discussion "Interfacing Ideologies: Dialogue or Battleground Within  the University and Society?" The opening panel at 9 a.m. on April 22  is titled "Planning for Cultural, Technological, and Academic  Diversity in University Studio Art Education." Workshops are  scheduled for both afternoons.
