SANTA CRUZ, CA--Three professors in the Division of Social Sciences at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, were honored today (Friday, October 3)  for their excellence in teaching.

The recipients of the Division of Social Sciences' 1996 Distinguished  Teaching Awards are:
* David Brundage, associate professor of community studies
* Carolyn Martin Shaw, professor of anthropology
* David Swanger, professor of education and creative writing

The award, which recognizes outstanding undergraduate teaching in the  social sciences, carries with it a $500 cash prize and an engraved plaque  that features a "golden apple."

Social Sciences Dean Martin Chemers announced the recipients at the  annual division convocation this morning. Recipients were selected by  Chemers from a list of recommendations compiled by a faculty committee  based on nominations put forth by department chairs. The committee was  chaired by Daniel Press, an assistant professor of environmental studies.  The annual awards were established in 1991 by former dean Eugene Garcia.

"I am happy to take a moment to honor these hardworking faculty  members," said Chemers. "Their enthusiasm and dedication set a standard for  us all, and I am honored to recognize their achievements."

Social sciences is one of four academic divisions at UCSC; the others  are arts, humanities, and natural sciences. Each division is home to a wide  range of departments and programs. Social sciences includes anthropology,  community studies, economics, education, environmental studies, Latin  American and Latino studies, legal studies, politics, psychology, and  sociology.
