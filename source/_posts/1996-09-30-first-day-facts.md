ENROLLMENT:

UCSC is expecting an opening-day enrollment of approximately 10,335 students, compared to a first-day enrollment of 10,136 last fall.

Of the expected 10,335 students, 3,000 will be new students (compared to 2,716 new students last fall).

These 3,000 new students were among more than 15,000 applicants for admission. The total number of applications received was the largest in UCSC history.  

PROFILE OF NEW STUDENTS:

The most popular declared majors are (in order): biology, psychology, literature, theater arts, environmental studies, art, marine biology, anthropology, economics, and computer science.

Nearly 20 percent of the new students come from the Monterey Bay-Santa Clara Valley region. In fact, almost 70 percent of the new students come from three geographic regions: San Francisco Bay Area, 26.1 percent; Los Angeles/South Coast, 23.8 percent; and Monterey Bay-Santa Clara Valley, 19.5 percent.

The ratio of women to men is 59-41.  

WHAT'S NEW:

The Student Affairs Division has developed a World Wide Web site that enables current (and prospective) students to assemble a "Success Team" of staff members who have the expertise to help students successfully meet the challenges of academic and campus life.

The division is also opening Web-based "chat rooms" in October to provide interactive answers to students' questions about such subjects as financial aid and housing.
