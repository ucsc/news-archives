SANTA CRUZ, CA--The term Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is a  relatively new way of describing the psychological aftershocks of a  trauma but the psychosis itself is nothing new, according to Boston  psychiatrist John Shay. Shay, who treats Vietnam veterans, says  that the condition was documented millennia earlier in Homer's  Iliad--the ancient Greek epic poem that narrates the story of the  Trojan War.

Shay will present a talk on the subject, titled "Achilles in  Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of Character," at 4 p.m. on  Tuesday, February 14, at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in  College Eight, Room 201.

The author of Achilles in Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the  Undoing of Character (New York: Atheneum and Maxwell Macmillan  International, 1994), Shay is a psychiatrist for the Veterans  Administration Outpatient Clinic in Boston and a member of the  faculty at Tufts Medical School. He has done extensive research on  the symptoms and treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in  Vietnam veterans.

Shay will explain similarities he has observed between the  experiences and emotional reactions of Vietnam vets and those of  the soldiers in Homer's Iliad. In his talk, he will focus on the story  of the warrior Achilles, who is distracted from the war by the  betrayal of his commander and the death of a number of close  friends. The grief, guilt, and numbness Achilles feels is followed by  frenzied rage--a pattern Shay says is frequently experienced by the  veterans with whom he works.

Shay is a leading scholar in the study of Post Traumatic Stress  Disorder in Vietnam veterans. His book is considered to be  groundbreaking in its detailed exploration of how combat trauma can  have a lasting and catastrophic effect on the lives of Vietnam  veterans.
