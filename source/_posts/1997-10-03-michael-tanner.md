**Re: Michael Tanner leaving Executive Vice Chancellor's post June 30**

Dear Colleagues:

As most of you know, Michael Tanner has served in a series of administrative positions for nearly a decade. He is widely respected by his peers throughout the University of California for his creativity, integrity, and preparedness. At UC Santa Cruz, in his capacity as Academic Vice Chancellor and then Executive Vice Chancellor, Michael has served with three Chancellors and has provided critical leadership to the campus in maintaining and developing its programs under perhaps the most trying administrative and fiscal restraints that this campus or the University of California system has experienced. Our campus has benefited greatly from his wisdom and ability to develop forward-looking administrative procedures and processes in consultation with the Academic Senate and other groups. He works tirelessly at his responsibilities and has devoted the majority of his academic career to our campus.

Thus, you can imagine my sadness at having to share with you that Executive Vice Chancellor Tanner has notified me that he wishes to return to his scholarly pursuits. After his extended administrative service, Michael plans some well-deserved time for research and contemplation of the topics at the forefront in his field and those facing higher education, especially as they relate to the intersections of new opportunities with information technology. I am very pleased that he has agreed to continue his service as Executive Vice Chancellor until June 30, 1998 or longer if necessary before a new person can assume these responsibilities. I hope you will all join me in thanking him for the many contributions he has made and will continue to make to the campus, and will assure him of your continuing commitment to working with him as we engage in shaping our future and facing its myriad challenges and opportunities

On a personal note, let me add, that no one could have provided more balanced advice or worked harder to help me understand the complexities and the opportunities here at UC Santa Cruz. I am looking forward to another year of progress in building the partnerships both within the campus and with our external constituencies on which our future depends, and I invite you all to participate in the important work of the campus this year.

A national search will be initiated immediately to identify Executive Vice Chancellor Tanner's successor. The search committee will be chaired by Professor Barbara Rogoff, and will include one faculty member from each of the remaining three divisions and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering. These members will be selected from among names (3-5 from each area) to be supplied by the Committee on Committees by October 20, 1997. In addition, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Francisco Hernandez, one provost, one dean, and two students (one undergraduate and one graduate student, to be selected from a slate of 3-5 provided by the SUA and the GSA, respectively) will serve. A staff member will be selected from a slate provided by the Staff Advisory Board. The full search committee will be announced when selected. The Chancellor will serve ex officio. Executive Assistant to the Chancellor Leslie Sunell will coordinate the search process. The committee's work will be conducted confidentially, and the committee may work with a professional search firm to ensure a pool of competitive candidates. The committee will provide the Chancellor with confidential evaluations of approximately 3-5 candidates for campus visits and final selection by the Chancellor.

Sincerely,

M.R.C. Greenwood  
Chancellor
