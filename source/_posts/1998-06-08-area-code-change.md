title: New Area Code Debuts In July&#58; Units Should Begin Planning For The Phone-number Change
author: Jim Burns

Beginning this July, campus telephone numbers will be assigned to a new area code--a change that requires campus units to assess their publications, other materials, and equipment to make sure that they incorporate the new 831 area code.

When the 831 area code takes effect on July 11, a six- month grace period begins in which callers can use either the old 408 code or the new code. Beginning in January 1999, however, the so-called "permissive" dialing period will end, and callers will be required to use the 831 area code to be connected.

"Planning should begin now in order to minimize the impact of the change--especially at the end of the permissive dialing period--when other campus units and area businesses may be competing for resources such as graphic production and printing  services," Larry Larson, UCSC's telecommunications manager, said in a May 22 letter to the campus community.

The new area code will encompass nearly all of Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Benito Counties. Pacific Bell had requested that the California Public Utilities Commission approve the new area code to meet demand for additional phone numbers.

Larson said the new area code could affect units' production of printed materials, such as brochures, mailers, business cards, or letterhead; their nonprinted information, such as Web pages or voice information systems; all publicized phone numbers, including fax, modem, pager, and cellular numbers; and equipment that dials programmed numbers, such as fax machines, modems, or autodialers.
