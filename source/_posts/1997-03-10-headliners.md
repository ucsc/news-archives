Dream expert **Veronica Tonay** was featured in an article in the _Daily Herald,_ a Chicago newspaper.

KUSP radio recently invited sociologist **John Brown Childs** to appear on the "Talk of the Bay" program. Childs, who was recently awarded a Fulbright Thomas Jefferson Chair award, is involved with the national urban youth antiviolence movement and Barrios Unidos in Santa Cruz.

The Monterey region is rapidly becoming "Silicon Valley, South," proclaimed a cover story in Monterey's major weekly newspaper, _Coast Weekly._ The article pointed to UCSC's MBEST Center at the former Fort Ord as evidence that the region is becoming a major player in the science and technology scene. MBEST director **Lora Lee Martin** earned lots of ink explaining the genesis of the research and technology park and its ambitious long-term goals.

Painter/photographer/psychologist **Pavel Machotka** recently received more media attention for his book, _Cézanne, Landscape into Art._ Both _Journal Française_ and _The Burlington Magazine_ spoke highly of the book, the latter noting that "of the many publications issued to coincide with the recent Cézanne retrospective, one (Machotka's) immediately takes its place as an indispensable work on the artist."

Praise for anthropologist **Carter Wilson's** book about AIDS in Mexico was echoed in the "Behind the Scenes" column of the _Lambda Book Report._
