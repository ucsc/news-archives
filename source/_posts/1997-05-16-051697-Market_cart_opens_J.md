SANTA CRUZ, CA--The popular market cart at UC Santa Cruz opens on  Tuesday, June 3, bringing the fresh organic bounty of the UCSC Farm and  Garden to cooks and flower lovers twice a week through the early fall.

Located at the main entrance of campus, the market cart features  picked-that-morning fruit, vegetables, and flowers. It will be open every  Tuesday and Friday afternoon from noon until 6 P.M. in front of the Barn  Theater at the intersection of Bay and High Streets.

Also available this year will be the popular cookbook, Recipes from the  Great Chefs of Santa Cruz County, which features recipes from 18 of the  county's premiere restaurants and catering companies. Each chef has  provided a full menu of recipes, from appetizers and salads to entr√©es and  desserts, with an emphasis on seasonal produce. Proceeds from the  cookbook, which sells for $19.95 plus tax, benefit the Friends of the UCSC  Farm and Garden.

Back again this year will be the cart's popular $5 bouquets, featuring  sweet peas, dramatic sunflowers, larkspur, alstroemeria, foxglove,  coreopsis, feverfew, and more. The array of fresh organic fruits and  vegetables grows as the season progresses, but early offerings include  gourmet salad mix, tender lettuces, several varieties of potatoes, and sweet  carrots. As summer progresses, watch for sweet corn, flavorful dry-farmed  tomatoes, an array of sweet and hot peppers, apples, plums, basil and other  herbs, and more.

The cart will be open through the summer and into the fall, depending  on the length of the growing season. All proceeds benefit the UCSC Center  for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems' apprenticeship program in  ecological horticulture. For more information, call (408) 459-3240.
