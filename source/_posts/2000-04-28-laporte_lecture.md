## UCSC Geologist Will Discuss Darwin And Christianity In A Free Public Lecture May 2

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Is the theory of evolution compatible with the Christian faith? What is evolution, and what is the scientific evidence for it? LÃ©o Laporte, professor emeritus of earth sciences at UC Santa Cruz, will address these and related questions from a scientific perspective in a lecture on Tuesday, May 2, at 7 p.m.

The lecture, which is free and open to the public, will be held at the First Congregational Church, 900 High Street, in Santa Cruz. According to Laporte, scientific study of fossils over the last 200 years documents what Darwin called "descent with modification," the phenomenon known today as evolution. Laporte notes, however, that there is no necessary conflict between evolution and religious beliefs, with the exception of fundamental Christian creationism.

In his talk, which will be illustrated with slides, Laporte will explain the difference between scientific methodology and the creationists' approach. After the talk there will be time for the audience to ask questions and for a conversation on the compatibility of scientific evolution and Christian belief. Alfred Williams, interim senior minister at First Congregational Church, will facilitate the questions and the conversation. Refreshments will be available.

Laporte is past president of the History of Earth Sciences Society and of the Society for Sedimentary Geology. He has taught courses in geology, paleontology, and evolution, and received the UCSC Alumni Distinguished Teaching Award in 1980. He currently is a consulting professor in the Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences at Stanford University. His forthcoming book, George Gaylord Simpson: Paleontologist and Evolutionist, will be published by Columbia University Press in the Fall (2000).
