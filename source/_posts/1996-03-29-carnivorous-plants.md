SANTA CRUZ, CA--A new carnivorous plant bog has added some bite  to the flowery displays of the Arboretum at the University of  California, Santa Cruz. Kids are not the only ones enthralled by the  insect-devouring plants, says Steve McCabe, a curator at the  Arboretum. "Most everybody likes the carnivorous plants--they're  just so weird."

An early spring trip to the Arboretum will also delight visitors  with the dashing aerial displays of hummingbirds, courting their  mates above the vividly flowering landscape. An up-close look at the  Arboretum's extensive collections, established in 1964, reveals a  fantastic world of strange plants from Australia, New Zealand, and  South Africa. For those who like to feel more at home with their  shrubbery, the Arboretum features many hardy California natives,  enticed into bloom by the recent rains.

The new display recreates the murky bogs of the U.S. Gulf  Coast, where plants prey on insects to make up for the nutrient-poor  soil. Nestled among granite boulders, the Venus's-flytrap is the most  famous carnivorous plant in the Arboretum bog. The thumbnail-sized  flytrap waits for its prey with pairs of specialized leaves cocked  open like bear traps. When an unsuspecting insect lands on the plant  and trips three hairs in a row, the leaves snap shut. The Venus's- flytrap clamps its trap by squirting water into cells that swell and  fold the leaf over--dooming the victim to death by slow digestion.

Most conspicuous in the bog are foot-high pitcher plants. Their  reddish veined leaves have evolved into long vertical tubes that jut  up out of the granite sand like snorkels. Insects slide down the slick  sides and perish in a pool of digestive juices. The cobra lily, native  to the Pacific Northwest, has even evolved a hood on top of its  pitcher to prevent rain from diluting its bug-digesting soup. Some  pitcher plants also have curved hairs to prevent insects from  crawling out. "It must be pretty scary for the insect," says McCabe.  "It can't figure the way out and slowly gets dissolved."

Short squat sundews capture their meals with leaves like  flypaper. Special glands ooze glistening drops of nectar, glue, and  digestive enzymes. The sweet-smelling but deadly mix lures insects  to the leaves. Once the struggling insect is stuck fast, the entire  leaf slowly curls around it in a tight embrace.

In a different spot, the Arboretum displays specimens of  Nepenthes, a vinelike carnivorous plant with even more versatile  foliage. The ends of the leaves twist into tendrils, which in turn  balloon into sausage-shaped pitchers. In the wilds of Madagascar,  Nepenthes plants can grow to 50 feet and--legend has it--can even  catch rats.

While carnivorous plants patiently wait for their next victims,  the Arboretum's resident hummingbirds sip nectar and scout for  mates. Hundreds of fragrant shrubs and trees draw Anna's  hummingbirds, Allen's hummingbirds, and other colorful species.  Visitors can see for themselves the floral feast of the  hummingbirds by visiting the Arboretum's unique gardens of the  Southern Hemisphere. Be prepared for bizarre plants with exotic  flowers. "It feels like you've gone into a different world," says  McCabe. "They're so unusual."

In the Australian garden, paths wind between more than 150  kinds of bushy Grevillea with oddly serrated leaves. The flowers of  Banksia plants resemble toothbrushes; others look like corn on the  cob or spiders' legs. And the bird-pollinated Protea, native to South  Africa and called "pink mink," flowers with feathery petals. Many  plants are now blooming in an eye-catching display of yellow,  orange, and red. "There's always something going on in the Australian  garden," says McCabe.

The Arboretum is open to the public every day from 9 a.m. to 5  p.m. for self-guided tours. Docents work at Norrie's gift shop  Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and on Sunday from  1 to 4 p.m. The Arboretum entrance is on Empire Grade in Santa Cruz,  one-half mile west of UCSC's main entrance on High Street.  Admission is free. For more information, call the Arboretum at (408)  427-2998.
