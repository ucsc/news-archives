The UC Santa Cruz Transportation and Parking Services Office (TAPS) has added two links to its Web site that provide timely road condition reports.

* The Santa Cruz County Road Conditions report is updated several times a day during the peak of heavy storm periods and appears to provide the best information on Santa Cruz County road closures. This is the same report that KSCO radio uses for its reports.
* The Bay Area Road Conditions report covers only the greater Bay Area, but provides reasonably timely reports.

In addition, the TravInfo hotline provides road reports by phone: (408) 817-1717. This remains the quickest, most reliable source of accurate and timely road condition reports available in our area.

To access these information sources, connect to the TAPS Web page at <http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps/new.html>. TAPS will add additional road-closure information resources to that site as they come available.

Finally, for information about conditions at UCSC during periods of possible emergency conditions, please remember to tune to KZSC 88.1 FM or call (408) 459-INFO (459-4636). Assuming electrical power is on, the campus Home Page also will be used.

Thank you.
