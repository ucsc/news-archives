SANTA CRUZ, CA--Salz Leathers, Inc., of Santa Cruz has established  a fellowship to support environmental research at the University of  California, Santa Cruz. The Salz Graduate Fellowship in  Environmental Chemistry will provide $16,000 per year to a  graduate student who conducts research on the effects of inorganic  contaminants in the marine environment--particularly within the  Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and its coastal lands.

Khalil Abu-Saba, a graduate student in chemistry, will receive  the fellowship for the 1994-95 academic year. Abu-Saba's research  focuses on chromium, a metal used in many industrial processes.  Depending on the type of chromium and its concentration, the metal  can have toxic effects in waters and soils. In previous work at UCSC,  Abu-Saba has analyzed chromium in San Francisco Bay, the San  Lorenzo River, and sediments at Fort Ord. For his Ph.D. dissertation,  he will use laboratory techniques to study other local sources of  chromium and the precise forms the metal can take in the  environment.

Norman Lezin, chairman and CEO of Salz Leathers, Inc., and  Ward Alksne, the company's environmental manager, were  responsible for creating the fellowship. Lezin is past president and  former member of the Board of Trustees of the UC Santa Cruz  Foundation. Alksne, a UCSC alumnus, received his B.A. in biology in  1989.

UCSC's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry will  administer the award. It will be available each year for an initial  period of two years to a new or continuing doctoral student in  chemistry, biology, or environmental studies.
