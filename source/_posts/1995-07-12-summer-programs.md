Although University of California, Santa Cruz, students are away for  the summer, there are still plenty of educational activities  occurring on the campus. Here are a number of programs at UCSC this  summer that would make interesting stories:

Monterey Peninsula College Math/Science Upward Bound (June 28- August 7). Forty high school students take part in this hands-on  educational program, which includes classes, lab work, and field  trips that teach science, mathematics, communications, and marine  biology. Many of the students come from limited-income backgrounds  or have parents who did not attend college. Recommended for Upward  Bound by teachers and counselors who feel they have the potential to  excel in the sciences, the students come from California, Nevada,  Arizona, Hawaii, Guam, and the Pacific Islands. They live at UCSC's  Porter College for the duration of the camp. A federally funded TRIO  program, Upward Bound serves limited-income families.

Contact: Stephen Ruth, coordinator, at (408) 469-3021, from 9  a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays, or at home at (408) 384-2267. Mary Ann  Hamann, TRIO project director at Monterey Peninsula College, can be  reached at (408) 646-4246.

UCSC Summer Session/Seaside Middle School Math/Science Institute  (July 2-14). Sixteen students from four middle schools in the  Monterey Peninsula Unified School District study physics, math,  marine biology, literature, astronomy, and computer graphics in this  program, which is sponsored by UCSC Summer Session. The two- week residential institute includes a daylong cruise on a research  boat and a day for parents to tour the campus. The program was  designed to introduce underrepresented students to UCSC and launch  them on a course toward college. UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister will  attend an awards ceremony for institute participants on Friday, July  14.

Avance Project (July 3-29). Also known as Proyecto Avance, this  two-year-old program is directed toward students from migrant  families who are over-age for the grade they are in at school. Thirty  students, from sixth to ninth grades, live at UCSC's Oakes College  for four weeks. They take courses that enable them to catch up to  their proper grade level, gain leadership and study skills, and learn  more about their culture.

Yo Puedo Program (July 3-29). Designed to foster self-esteem and  self-confidence in high school students by helping them develop  leadership and decision-making skills, Yo Puedo is sponsored and  funded by the Migrant Education Program, Region XVI, of the  Monterey County Office of Education. The camp is open to and free  for teenagers from migrant families. While living at UCSC's Crown  College, the students participate in a full schedule of activities:  classes in computers, math, science, and literature; training in  study skills and time management; and outdoor hikes, barbecues, and  field trips.

Summer Bridge Program (July 8-August 11). This challenging five- week residential program will prepare nearly 100 incoming  freshmen this year for college-level work at UCSC. Summer Bridge  includes academic, social, and cultural activities designed to help  students become familiar with an academic atmosphere and  strengthen their analytical, critical-thinking, and problem-solving  skills. It is one of several programs from UCSC's Student  Affirmative Action/Educational Opportunity Programs.

Camp Akili Summer Leadership Camp (July 13-16). A residential  camp for Oakland and San Francisco Bay Area African American  teens between the ages of 14 and 18, Camp Akili aims to help its  campers develop self-esteem, cultural pride, and leadership skills.  The camp's workshops and other activities are paired with videos  about social issues such as AIDS, violence, sexism, and racism.  After watching the videos, campers discuss them and do role- playing exercises, said Shawn Ginwright, Camp Akili executive  director. Approximately 60 students will take part this year. The  camp is sponsored by Leadership Excellence Inc., an Oakland-based  nonprofit organization.
