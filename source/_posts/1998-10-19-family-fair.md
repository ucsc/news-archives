Children's folk music, pony rides, a barbecue, and a petting zoo are just a few of the fun activities offered at the Family Fair, taking place Sunday, October 25, from noon to 4 p.m. on the playing field in front of UCSC's Family Student Housing.

"The fair is a great way to connect with other UCSC families," said event organizer Gail Bloebaum,"and it's really neat for kids."

The fair is free and open to all students, faculty, and staff and their families. For a $5 fee, participants can have their photo taken by UCSC Photo Services.

At the fair, children can get their faces painted, listen to a gypsy ensemble, watch a juggler at work, or bounce around in one of two Astro Jumps. Kids can also hear a presentation by McGruff the Crime Dog or get their fingerprints recorded by the UCSC Police Department.

The Family Fair kicks off Family Student Housing's "celebrate family" events for the year, which include a children's concert in February, a dining-hall night for families, and "free laundry night."

The fair is sponsored by Housing, Dining, and Child Care Services, Student Affairs, Human Resources, the Executive Vice Chancellor's Office, OPERS, Food Service, and the Staff Advisory Board.

Approximately 800 people are expected to attend the event, which is in its fourth year.

For more information, call Gail Bloebaum.
