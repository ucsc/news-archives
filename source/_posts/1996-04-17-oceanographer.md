SANTA CRUZ, CA--Oceanographer Mary Silver has received the  "outstanding faculty award" for 1995-96 from her peers in the  Natural Sciences Division at UC Santa Cruz. The annual award honors  excellence in three areas: research, teaching, and service to the  campus, scientific organizations, and the public.

Silver, a professor of marine sciences, focuses her research on  oceanic particles called "marine snow." These falling bits of  detritus carry food from shallow waters to scavengers of the deep.  Silver collaborates with researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium  Research Institute, where she uses remotely operated vehicles to  get an up-close look at the tadpole-like larvaceans that produce  much of the falling marine snow. Larvaceans secrete sticky mucus  nets to trap passing bits of food. When done feeding, they release  their gooey "homes," which plummet to the ocean floor. The mucus  nets carry with them leftover food scraps and a whole community of  planktonic decomposers feasting on the remains.

In recognition of her innovative research, Silver shared the  prestigious Henry Bryant Bigelow Medal in Oceanography in 1992, an  award given just once every four years. She also received a rare  accomplishment-based renewal of a grant from the National Science  Foundation.

Students have consistently praised Silver's teaching as  outstanding in a variety of courses, from introductory biology to a  specialized graduate course in marine plankton. One recent student  wrote, "Mary is the best instructor I've had yet." In 1991, the UCSC  Alumni Association selected Silver as one of several recipients of  the "Favorite Professor Award."

Silver has actively supported women in science. Duke  University selected her as its first "Women in Earth and Marine  Science Distinguished Lecturer," and she has lectured at other  campuses on issues faced by women pursuing scientific careers.

Silver earned her Ph.D. in 1971 from the Scripps Institution of  Oceanography at UC San Diego and joined the UCSC faculty in 1972.  She was chair of the Marine Sciences Board of Studies from 1992 to  1995.
