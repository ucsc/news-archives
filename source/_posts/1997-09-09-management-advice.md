**'Heavy Mettle' Is Key To Success, Says Author Of The New Book An Integrative Theory Of Leadership**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The most powerful forces shaping a leader's  success are his or her self-confidence and the degree of trust a  group has in its leader. In fact, says organizational management  expert Martin Chemers, those qualities play as big a role as talent in  forging a leader's success.

Chemers, who has studied leadership effectiveness among  corporate executives, college basketball players, fast-food  managers, military leaders, and ROTC students, dubs qualities such  as confidence and optimism "mettle."

"There are two sources of mettle," said Chemers, a professor  of psychology and dean of the Social Sciences Division at the  University of California, Santa Cruz. "The first is part of an  individual's disposition--your belief in your leadership ability-- because a big part of leadership is convincing your subordinates that  you can do the job. And the second is the degree to which you feel  that you fit in and are accepted as a leader."

The second point has important implications for women and  minorities in leadership positions who may find themselves in  situations that "leach away" their feelings of acceptance as others  either purposefully or inadvertently create on-the-job hardships.  "Making women and minorities feel a part of an organization  empowers them and will allow them to perform effectively," said  Chemers, whose specialties include organizational psychology,  cross-cultural management, job stress and illness, and management  training.

When it comes to powerful social forces such as sexism and  racism, added Chemers: "It's up to senior management and top  executives to establish a climate of confidence in their appointed  leaders."

Each success helps break down persistent negative stereotypes  that women and minorities make poor leaders, noted Chemers.  Organizations can lend support to their leaders by helping them build  up their individual mettle, too. "Organizations today have to be based  on the assumption that everyone can do the job," said Chemers.  "Failures by minorities and women have to be seen as organizational  failures, not individual ones."

Such a climate of shared responsibility, in which everyone  feels accountable for the performance and development of every  worker, begins at the top, he said. "When managers build  relationships with subordinates, it's important to foster a climate  of interdependence and mutuality," said Chemers. "You set the tone in  your unit, and you can create the expectation of impartiality."

Sports teams provide a useful model of what Chemers calls a  "culture of performance." "Good teams stay good for years," said  Chemers. "Winning teams--and successful companies--usually have  successful leaders."

Chemers is the author of the new book An Integrative Theory of  Leadership (Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1997) and  dozens of academic articles on organizational leadership.

In An Integrative Theory of Leadership, Chemers offers a  comprehensive overview of leadership theory and concludes that  factors such as confidence, competence, trustworthiness, the ability  to provide guidance and inspiration, and the talent to mobilize one's  own resources and those of one's team are critical elements of  effective leadership. He is also the coeditor of Diversity in  Organizations: New Perspectives for a Changing Workplace (Thousand  Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc., 1995). He joined the UCSC faculty  in 1995.
