SAN FRANCISCO--Francisco J. Hernandez has been appointed to fill  the position of vice chancellor for student affairs at the University  of California, Santa Cruz. The appointment, which will take effect  September 1, was approved today (Friday, July 15) by UC's Board of  Regents.

Offered UCSC's top student affairs post after a national  search, Hernandez will assume responsibility for an administrative  division with more than 350 employees and an annual operating  budget of $43 million. Hernandez's annual salary will be $105,000.

He will replace C. James Quann, who will return full-time to  the post of UCSC's registrar. Quann has served in the dual capacity of  registrar and interim vice chancellor for student affairs since  October.

Hernandez comes to the Santa Cruz campus from UC Berkeley,  where he has served as assistant vice chancellor/dean of students in  the Office for Undergraduate Affairs since July 1989. In that  capacity, Hernandez has assumed responsibility for all student-life  issues, supervised student advising services and career and graduate  school services, coordinated special grant projects for low-income  students, and supervised the Office of Student Activities and  Services. His duties at UC Berkeley also included interaction with  the campus's Multicultural Action Team and the Women's Resource  Center.

"We are extremely fortunate to gain the services of someone of  Dr. Hernandez's caliber for this critical administrative position at  UC Santa Cruz," UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister said. "His extensive  experience within the UC system will prove invaluable as we provide  vital services to current UCSC students as well as prepare for the  needs of those who will enroll in future years."

Administrative units that will report to Hernandez include  Accounts Receivable,  Admissions, Arts & Lectures, the Bay Tree Bookstore, Career & Internship Services, Child Care Services, Counseling and  Psychological Services, Disabled Student Services, Financial Aid,  the Rape Prevention Education Program, Office of the Registrar,  Student Affirmative Action andEducational Opportunity Programs,  Student Health Services, Housing, the Office of African-American  Student Life, the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and  Sports, Student Organization Advising and Resources, Student  Employment Services, the Women's Center, Re-Entry Services, and  the nonacademic administration of UCSC's eight colleges.

Hernandez received a bachelor of arts degree in American  history in 1970 from UC Berkeley, a master's degree in education  from Stanford University in 1976, and a Ph.D. in philosophy with a  minor in Chicano history from Stanford in 1982. Since 1976, he has  also taught a variety of courses in Chicano studies and Mexican- American studies--as a lecturer, adjunct lecturer, and assistant  professor at UC Berkeley and Sonoma State University.

"UC Santa Cruz is an excellent university in a wonderful  setting," Hernandez said. "I look forward to working with the people  who perform the critical support services for enrolled as well as  prospective students."

Hernandez, 46, and his wife, Veronica Hinojosa, have three  children.
