United Way of Santa Cruz County honored UCSC and one of its employees last week for participation in the organization's 1997 fund-raising campaign.

The campus community earned the Gold Award as the highest donor in the education division, said Cary Oliva, director of development for United Way. Nearly 650 members of UCSC's faculty and staff contributed a total of $72,520 this year, an increase of 3 percent over last year's total. After Granite Rock Company, UCSC contributed the largest amount of any local organization. The university's contributions have been increasing steadily for the past six years.

Countywide, United Way collected $508,000, exceeding its campaign goal.

Carol Lacey of the Chancellor's Office, who organized the United Way campaign at UCSC, received an "Oscar" statuette from the nonprofit organization as an outstanding campaign coordinator.

The campaign, which lasted from mid-October through mid-November, was kicked off this year by Chancellor Greenwood and other administrators with an ice cream social.
