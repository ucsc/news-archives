Professor of linguistics Judith Aissen will present a talk titled, "Linguistic Work Among the Maya." Her talk is part of the 1998-99 Humanities Lecture Series, sponsored jointly by UCSC's Humanities Division and the Museum of Art and History. It takes place from 7 to 8 p.m. on Thursday, January 14, at the Museum of Art and History at the McPherson Center, 705 Front St., Santa Cruz. The talk is free and open to the public. A reception follows.

There are currently some 30 forms of Mayan spoken today in Mexico and Guatemala. Aissen is an expert on the structures of these languages and will discuss some of those structures as well as the writing systems of the languages.

Aissen is the author of _Tzotzil Clause Structure_ (Reidel, 1987) and has written numerous journal articles on aspects of Mayan syntax.
