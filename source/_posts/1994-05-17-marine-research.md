SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Dr. Earl H. Myers and Ethel M. Myers  Oceanographic and Marine Biology Trust of Pebble Beach recently  granted $13,300 to fourteen students at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, who conduct marine-related research.

The trust was established by the estates of Earl H. Myers, an  internationally known oceanographic biologist at Stanford  University's Hopkins Marine Station who died in 1975, and his wife  and research assistant Ethel M. Myers, who died in 1985. Dividends  and interest on the trust's principal finance the full amount of the  grants each year.

This year, the eighth year of the program, 34 students in the  Monterey Bay Area received a total of $34,700 for their marine  studies. The other recipients conduct research at the Hopkins Marine  Station or at California State University's Moss Landing Marine  Laboratories.

Awards ranging from $500 to $1,500 went to the following  UCSC students: Leif Abrell, doctoral student in chemistry; Jon  Ashen, Suzanne Kohin, Brenda Konar, Eric Mintz, Catherine Quinones,  and Kerstin Wasson, doctoral students in biology; and Donald Bard,  Karen Eason, Stacia Fletcher, Sarah Gerken, Mary Hogan, Kristine  Rodgers, and Jocelyn Vedder, master's students in marine sciences.
