SANTA CRUZ, CA--Marc Mangel, a professor of conservation biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is among a select group of researchers being honored by their peers in statistical ecology this summer at an international meeting in Florence, Italy.

Mangel will receive the Distinguished Statistical Ecologist Award today (Monday, July 20, 1998) from the Statistical Ecology Group of the International Association for Ecology. The international group meets every four years.

The awards were established in 1986 to honor "outstanding contributions to the development of basic concepts and applications of statistical ecology." The awards recognize the cross-disciplinary focus of statistical ecology and are given to academic, governmental, and industrial scientists working on problems in the field. Mangel is one of 25 recipients being honored this summer.

Mangel, who will not attend the awards ceremony because he is hosting an international meeting on foraging at UCSC July 22-24, is the coauthor of The Ecological Detective: Confronting Models with Data. The book offers ecologists the tools to apply more sophisticated statistical methods to their data. The book is designed to provide a link between standard ecological modeling, or theoretical ecology, and serious statistical texts. The title refers to the work ecologists do collecting clues and assembling them into a coherent picture.

Mangel's research focuses on the ecological implications of natural variation within populations of organisms. He specializes in the life history of salmonids, especially Atlantic salmon, coastal coho salmon, and steelhead trout. He has also studied fruit flies, including the Medfly and the apple maggot, and krill in both the North Pacific and Antarctic Oceans. He currently serves as a member of the National Marine Fisheries Service Ecosystems Advisory Panel, which will advise Congress on the application of ecosystem principles in U.S. fisheries management. He was recently appointed to the Science Advisory Board of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara.
