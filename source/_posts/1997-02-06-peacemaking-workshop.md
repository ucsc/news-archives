SANTA CRUZ, CA--The recent signing of the Guatemalan peace accords ended  one of this century's bloodiest civil wars. Susanne Jonas of the Latin  American and Latino studies program at UC Santa Cruz is a leading U.S.  authority on the war in Guatemala, and she will be participating in a two-day  workshop on peacemaking at UCSC on February 27-28.

The event, titled "Peacemaking and Conflict Resolution at Home and  Abroad," will focus on peace efforts in Guatemala, Bosnia, the Middle East,  Northern Ireland, South Africa, and the urban United States.

"Given the number of conflicts and wars that we've seen around the  world since the end of the Cold War, it's important for us to figure out how to  end them," says Ronnie Lipschutz, associate professor of politics at UCSC and  organizer of the event. "We'll be looking at these cases for ideas that can be  generalized to other places."

The workshop is free and open to the public. It will be held in the  Fireside Lounge at UCSC's Stevenson College; a detailed schedule follows. The  event is sponsored by the Stevenson Program on Global Security and the Center  for Global, International, and Regional Studies. The workshop is being funded  by the University of California's Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation  at UC San Diego. For more information, call (408) 459-2833.
