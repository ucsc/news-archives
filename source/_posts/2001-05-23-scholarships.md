SANTA CRUZ, CA--Thirteen talented community college students are headed to UC Santa Cruz this fall thanks to a generous scholarship program that provides students with $20,000 to complete their education at the university. Recipients of the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards are selected in recognition of their accomplishments despite adverse socioeconomic circumstances. The awards program was established in 1993 to help more community college students transfer to UCSC.

Recipients receive $10,000 scholarships for each of two years, as well as the support of a strong academic mentoring program and assistance finding paid summer work experience in a field that complements their studies.

"I am delighted to present these students with an opportunity that might otherwise have been beyond their reach," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "This scholarship program is one of the most tangible symbols of our commitment to making a University of California education available to more well-prepared students than ever before."

The scholarship program was established by former UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister to recognize students who have made a demonstrated commitment to assisting and improving the lives of others, who have overcome adverse socioeconomic circumstances, and who might not otherwise be able to attend UCSC for financial reasons. Candidates are nominated by the presidents of each of 13 regional community colleges, and recipients are selected by Greenwood in consultation with the Leadership Opportunity Awards Program Screening Committee.

A list of this year's recipients follows, with hometowns and college affiliations. Biographical information about each recipient is also available below. For more information about the scholarship program or any of the recipients, call the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-2495.
