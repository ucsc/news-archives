## "Magical School Bus Ride" Brings High School Students To UC Santa Cruz

What: Forty-five students from Dominguez High School in the Compton area of Los Angeles are taking a two-week "magical school bus" tour of California marine science facilities operated by the University of California.

The Educational Partnership Center at UC Santa Cruz is participating in the tour by hosting the students for five days.

When: August 10-15

Where: Oakes College, UC Santa Cruz

The students will stay at Oakes College on the UCSC campus. During their visit, they will tour the campus and visit UCSC's marine science facilities, Long Marine Laboratory, the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, and a UCSC research site at Elkhorn Slough. They will also attend a Shakespeare Santa Cruz performance and visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the Santa Cruz Boardwalk.

Why: The tour is part of the University of California's ongoing effort to expand the pool of students from Los Angeles County who are academically prepared to attend a UC campus. By exposing top students to UC faculty and facilities, tour coordinators hope to encourage students to apply to the University of California.

The group will spend three or four days at each campus (UC Santa Barbara, UC Davis's marine laboratory at Bodega Bay, and UCSC), living in the dorms, visiting research labs, and learning about marine science. During the bus ride, students will be briefed about the unique offerings available at their next stop. In addition to marine science, the tour will emphasize current environmental issues, agriculture, California history, and immigration.

Who: Participating students were selected from a list of the school's best students that was compiled by teachers at Dominguez High School. The cost of the tour is fully covered by the University of California.
