**Author Of Famous 1996 Hoax In Journal Social Text Is Part Of A  Distinguished Group That Will Debate Recent Social And Historical  Interpretations Of Science May 10-11**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Leading researchers from the natural sciences,  social sciences, and humanities will convene at UC Santa Cruz for a  weekend conference on one of the hottest topics in higher education  today: Is science just another cultural and political construct?

The conference, "Science, Science Studies, and Their Critics,"  runs from 8:50 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday, May 10, and from 9 a.m. to  noon on Sunday, May 11, in Classroom Unit 2 on the UCSC campus.  Although primarily intended for the university community, the  conference will be open to the public if space permits. Admission is  free.

Co-organizers Michael Nauenberg, a physicist at UC Santa Cruz,  and Theodore Porter, a historian at UCLA, hope to foster reasoned  debate among researchers on both sides of what has become a  profound--and very public--intellectual divide. In one camp are  scientists defending the objectivity of their work and nature's  absolute truths. In the other are those who claim that critical  investigations of science and technology, and the role society plays  in shaping scientific pursuits, reveal that science and culture are  inextricably linked.

"It is our goal," Nauenberg and Porter state, "to bring together  scientists and those who write about the history and sociology of  science to build the groundwork for intellectually productive  discussion around issues of current interest."

Vitriolic exchanges in the press and at meetings last year  built no such foundation. The catalyst was a now-famous hoax  published in the postmodern journal Social Text by New York  University physicist Alan Sokal, who will speak at the conference.  The article, titled "Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a  Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity," was (in the  words of an article in New Republic) a "random assortment of  arcane, jargon-infested abstractions . . . devoid of both evidence and  reasoned argument." Indeed, Sokal says that any knowledgeable  physicist would have dismissed the manuscript summarily had the  editors of Social Text bothered to seek such a review.

"What does it say about the state of academic life that leading  scholars were unable to distinguish serious argument from utter  nonsense?" asked Peter Berkowitz in his New Republic story.

In recent months, the debate has become more circumspect. An  editorial in the leading journal Nature called for "respect and rigour"  and urged its readers not to reject "science studies" out of hand.  Newsweek devoted four pages of its April 21 issue to the topic,  concluding that recognizing and neutralizing biases in science is a  "war worth fighting."

"We need to bridge the gap between these sharply opposed  points of view," said Nauenberg. "These issues all touch on sensitive  territories, but it's the very nature of the university that we should  debate them in the open."

Three sessions are scheduled for the conference: "Perspectives  on Science and its Sociology," "Postmodernism, Cultural Studies, and  the Philosophy of Science," and "Cultural History and History of  Science." Each session will feature two speakers and a panel of five  or six researchers for discussion. There will be time for the  audience to participate as well. (See below for a roster of panelists  and a complete schedule.)

Sponsors of the conference are UCSC's Natural Sciences  Division, Social Sciences Division, and Office of Research; the UC  Humanities Research Institute; and the Center for Cultural Studies  of Science, Technology, and Medicine at UCLA.
