title: Good News For Aspiring Teachers

Twenty-three aspiring teachers at UCSC got some really good news this fall: A program that encourages teachers to work in areas of great need by repaying their student loans has been expanded. As a result, 23 incoming and second-year students in the teacher credential program will be eligible for up to $11,000 in aid during their first four years in the classroom.

The Assumption Program of Loans for Educators is a state-funded program known informally as "APLE," said UCSC credential analyst Elaine Rivas. It is administered by the California Student Aid Commission, and each year two or three UCSC students have been selected in the spring from those nominated, she said.

"But this year, after the initial selection of three candidates, the program administrators called us in early September and asked if we had any other potential nominees," recalled Rivas. "I said, 'Sure, I've got 20 more eligible applicants,' and they took them all." Allocations have increased from a maximum of $8,000 per student to $11,000, she noted. Repayments are spread out in four annual installments of $2,000 the first year and $3,000 each subsequent year.

"This program is part of the state's effort to recruit and reward those who teach in areas of critical need," said Rivas. "It's also an incentive that helps retain teachers new to the profession."

To be eligible, students must commit to work for four years in a "shortage area," which includes teaching math, science, English, bilingual education, special education, foreign language or reading, or working in a low-income school.

Statewide, the program was expanded from 400 to 4,500 teachers-in-training, said Rivas.

More good news is here, said Rivas, adding that Cal-T grants for teacher candidates are being offered this year for the first time. The grants cover registration and tuition fees up to $3,600 per year for UC students in credential programs. UCSC has more than 80 students in its credential program this year.
