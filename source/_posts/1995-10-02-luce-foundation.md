**Grant Will Be Used To Study The Recent History Of Women And Work In China**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A $150,000 three-year grant from the Henry Luce  Foundation will support a collaboration between U.S. and Chinese  scholars to study women in the labor force in China from 1949 to  the present. The grant was awarded to three faculty members at the  University of California, Santa Cruz. The three have just returned  from the United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women in  Beijing, where they met with their Chinese colleagues to plan the  project.

Titled "A Cultural History of Women and Work in Twentieth-  Century China," the project was conceived by Emily Honig, professor  of women's studies; Gail Hershatter, professor of history; and Lisa  Rofel, assistant professor of anthropology. The Luce grant will make  it possible for the three to travel to China to study local archives,  gather oral histories, and consult with their Chinese counterparts.  The grant will also support residencies at UCSC for the seven  Chinese scholars involved in the collaboration.

While all three UCSC faculty will explore the theme of women  and work in postrevolution China, each will focus on a different era.  Hershatter will study the 1950s, regarded as the golden age of  socialism in China. Honig will examine the Cultural Revolution--the  time from 1966 to 1976 when Chairman Mao Tse-tung launched an  all-out campaign to attack those within the Communist Party whom  he felt had abandoned the principles of the revolution. Rofel will  concentrate on contemporary China, examining how people's cultural  values have been influenced by the introduction of a market economy.

Rofel stresses that, "The emphasis of the project is to do  collaborative work with scholars in China. There's been a wonderful  burgeoning of women's studies in China in the past decade. We first  went to China two years ago to meet these women and see what  they're doing. Now that the grant is in place, we can map out the  specifics."

For Hershatter, travel to China will give her an opportunity to  collect oral histories from people who experienced the 1949  communist takeover and the ensuing "golden age" of communism in  China. "I want to know how that first decade is remembered by those  who lived through it and how it is taught to young Chinese now," she  explains.

"The new leadership created dramatic changes in the status  and quality of life for Chinese women," Hershatter adds. "Previously,  women in the paid labor force were looked down on and often  suspected of prostitution. In the new society it was a glorious thing  to be a worker, so the status of working women changed--they were  considered heroines."

Honig wants to learn how Mao's ideology affected the types of  jobs women held. "During the Cultural Revolution one of Mao's  popular slogans stated that women could do anything men could do.  One way he promoted that idea was with posters that showed women  doing unconventional jobs like repairing high-voltage wiring," she  says. "I want to see if that ideology influenced people's attitudes  and beliefs about the work women could do." Honig plans to research  the archives of local counties and to conduct oral history  interviews.

Rofel, a cultural anthropologist, is looking at the lives of  working women in modern China. "In the mid-1980s the market  economy began to take hold, and trade and distribution flourished.  Since then, large multinational factories have been drawing women  to the coastal areas for work. They come from small inland villages  to these industrial coastal cities. I'm curious about how their values  and relationships with their villages change when they move."  Rofel's research will involve intensive observation and interviews  with factory workers.

The first residency at UCSC by Chinese scholars is planned for  the spring of 1996. Three visiting faculty will present talks and  participate in workshops and seminars.

The grant was announced August 14 by the Henry Luce  Foundation, which awarded a total of $11.9 million this year. The  foundation was established in 1936 by the late Henry R. Luce, co- founder and editor-in-chief of Time, Inc. With assets of $500  million, the foundation supports programs in higher education, Asian  studies, American art, theology, public affairs, and women in  science and engineering.

This is the third grant the UCSC project has received; the  first, totaling $10,000, was awarded in 1994-95 by the University  of California Pacific Rim Research Program, which awarded an  additional grant of $35,990 to the project in May for 1995-96.
