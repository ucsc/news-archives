**Balloons Explode, Polymers Expand, Solutions Glow In The Dark--and It's Real Science**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Chemist and educator Bassam Z. Shakhashiri, whose  entertaining lectures captivate children and adults alike, will deliver his  popular "Science is Fun" presentation at UC Santa Cruz on Thursday, March  12\. The lecture-demonstration, open to the public at no charge, will begin at  7 P.M. in the Performing Arts Main Stage on the UCSC campus.

Shakhashiri is a professor of chemistry at the University of  Wisconsin-Madison, and his chemical demonstration shows, including his  "Science is Fun" lectures, have been carried on PBS television stations  throughout the country. The professor's experiments are entertaining-- balloons explode, polymers expand, solutions glow in the dark--and highly  regarded for the scientific principles that they teach.

Shakhashiri has played to packed houses in a variety of venues,  including the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian's National  Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Science in  Boston. His popular lecture, "Once Upon a Christmas Cheery, In the Lab of  Shakhashiri," is carried on TV stations throughout the country each  December.

A native of Lebanon, Shakhashiri came to the United States with his  family in 1957 when he was 18. He completed an A.B. in chemistry at Boston  University (1960) and earned a master's degree and Ph.D. in chemistry from  the University of Maryland (1964 and 1968). He joined the faculty of the  University of Wisconsin in 1970.

Professor Shakhashiri has a distinguished record of service in the area  of science education, having served as assistant director of science and  engineering education for the National Science Foundation. In that position,  he was responsible for the design and administration of a variety of  programs to improve all levels of education in mathematics, engineering,  and the sciences.

His visit to UCSC is sponsored by the campus's Division of Natural  Sciences.
