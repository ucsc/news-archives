SANTA CRUZ, CA--A unique summer camp at UC Santa Cruz will give youngsters ages seven to eleven an opportunity to explore the UCSC Farm, local wilderness areas, and Natural Bridges State Park.

Two four-day sessions are being offered this summer by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems at the UCSC Farm. The sessions mark the revival of a popular program that began in 1983. Dubbed "Wildlands and Watering Cans," the UCSC Farm and Garden summer camp ran until 1986.

This year, the fun returns with activities geared toward giving children hands-on experience in organic farming and gardening, increasing environmental awareness, and encouraging cooperation and fun in the outdoors. Activities will include gardening, hiking, making homemade root beer and ice cream, beach walks, crafts, insect and plant identification projects, and more.

"We want children to make connections between wildland and garden ecosystems, and we want them to have a lot of fun at the Farm," said John Fisher, the new outreach coordinator at UCSC's Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, who was instrumental in reviving the summer camp. "We'll focus on learning the importance of interacting sustainably with the world around us."

Instructors Deleh Pasewalk and John Welch each have experience teaching young children, and both are knowledgeable about gardening and local natural history.

The first session will run from July 27-30; the second session will run from August 3-6. Each session will run from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and cost $140. Some $70 scholarships will be available. The registration deadline is July 22; scholarship applicants must register by July 15.

The camp is being sponsored by the Friends of the UCSC Farm and Garden. To register, or for more information, call John Fisher at (408) 459- 3248.
