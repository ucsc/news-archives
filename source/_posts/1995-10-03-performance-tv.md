SANTA CRUZ, CA--Taking in an evening of theater will be as simple  as turning on the television this fall. On October 9, an eleven-week  series titled "UCSC Theater Arts Board Presents" will air on the  Community Television of Santa Cruz County channel (TCI cable  channel 71). The series features twenty works produced in the  spring of 1995 by faculty and students at the University of  California, Santa Cruz.

The series features more than 100 students in twenty plays  and dance pieces produced by UCSC's Theater Arts Board last spring.  Nineteen of twenty pieces were presented as part of Chautauqua, an  annual festival of student-produced theater. Leading off the series  will be Effie and the Barbarians, adapted from Euripides' Iphigenia  Among the Taurians and directed by Mary-Kay Gamel, UCSC associate  professor of classics, comparative literature, and theater arts.

The series is produced by Dan Klevesahl, a fifth-year student  in UCSC's Theater Arts Graduate Certificate Program. Klevesahl, who  has more than six years' experience in public access television and  video production, oversaw taping and edited each play for cablecast.

Shows, which run two hours unless otherwise noted, will be  cablecast Mondays at 9 p.m. from October 9 through December 18 on  TCI channel 71 as follows:
