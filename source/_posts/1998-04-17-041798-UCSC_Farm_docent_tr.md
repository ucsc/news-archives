## UC Santa Cruz Farm Docent Training Begins May 14

SANTA CRUZ, CA--If you're interested in alternative agriculture and enjoy  working with people, now is the time to consider volunteering as a docent at  the 25-acre organic Farm at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  Applications are available now for the six-week docent training program,  which begins May 14.

During the training, docents will learn about organic farming and gardening  methods, issues in sustainable agriculture, and the basic principles of leading  interpretive tours, including tours for children. After the training, docents  will participate in activities that include tours and public education programs,  community events, plantings, and harvests. In addition to the six-week  training, docents are encouraged to attend enrichment classes on a range of  topics, including beekeeping, pruning, children's gardening, permaculture,  and culinary and medicinal herb culture.

The initial training consists of six four-hour sessions on Thursdays from 1 to  5 p.m., May 14 through June 18. Participants will learn how to lead tours for  the Farm & Garden's many visitors--from children to seniors and from  novices to international scholars. Many visitors are Spanish speakers, so  bilingual volunteers are needed, too. A $30 fee covers the cost of materials, a  docent manual, and a Farm & Garden organic cotton T-shirt.

After completing the training, docents must volunteer at least six hours per  month and attend monthly educational meetings.

Class size is limited, so advance registration is recommended. Applications  and other materials are available from John Fisher at the Center for  Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, UCSC, 1156 High Street, Santa  Cruz, CA 95064, by calling (408) 459-3248, or by sending e-mail to  johnfish@cats.ucsc.edu.
