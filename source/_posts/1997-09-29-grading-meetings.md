title: Registrar's Office Schedules Meetings To Discuss New Grading Procedures
author: Jim Burns

Beginning this quarter, new UCSC undergraduates can accumulate a grade-point average, while new _and_ continuing students may request letter  grades in almost every class. In addition, graduate students are also eligible  to request letter grades for the first time.

The Academic Senate approved these changes last year on the  recommendation of the Committee on Educational Policy and the Graduate  Council, whose faculty members maintained that a revised grading policy  would provide UCSC students with more options while retaining the campus's  traditional Narrative Evaluation System.

Now that the changes are  taking effect, however, the Registrar's Office is  doing everything possible to ensure that students, faculty, lecturers, and  others in the campus community aren't tripped up by the new grading  policies. Toward that end, the office has scheduled four informational  sessions in the next five weeks to discuss new policies and deadlines  prompted by changes in UCSC's grading system.

The sessions are scheduled at the following times and locations:
* Tuesday, October 7, 3-4:30, Cowell Health Center Conference Room.
* Wednesday, October 8, 11:30-1, Stevenson Fireside Lounge.
* Tuesday, November 4, 3-4:30, College Eight Commons Room, #201.
* Wednesday, November 5, 11:30-1, Stevenson Fireside Lounge.

Until this year, students  could elect to supplement narrative evaluations  with letter grades in some lower-division and most upper-division courses.  Even in courses in which grades were offered, students received either an  "A," "B," "C," or "No Pass." This fall, however, everyone responsible for a  section (with the exception of college core courses, student-directed  seminars, physical education classes, and a handful of other courses) must  know the nuances of evaluating with grades, including "D"s and "F"s.

"There may be an increase in requests for grades, especially from new  students who want to acquire a GPA," predicts Nancy Pascal, associate  registrar. "The new GPA, the increased number of courses in which grades  are offered, and many new deadlines and procedure changes may be  confusing in this first quarter."

The GPA procedures alone may be confusing at first, Pascal says.  Cumulative GPAs, for example, may come and go on the end-of-quarter  records the Registrar's Office provides students and sends off campus to  graduate schools or other parties. "The GPA will appear only if the student  has requested letters grades in at least two-thirds of the credits attempted  at UCSC, so meeting or not meeting that threshold could change from quarter  to quarter," she says.

Registrar's Office staff also view it as imperative that students requesting  an "incomplete" understand the different way that option is treated if a letter  grade was or was not requested. "If a student receives an 'incomplete' in a  course in which he or she elected a letter grade--and the student fails to  complete the work or file a petition on time--the incomplete will be changed  to an 'F,' which will be part of the student's permanent record," Pascal says.

"That's just one important example of a policy change," says Pascal, who  strongly encourages members of the campus community who have any  uncertainty about the changes in grading procedures to attend one of the  information sessions. "The four meetings probably won't eliminate all  confusion this quarter, but they could greatly reduce it."
