SANTA CRUZ, CA--Author Judy Yung will discuss her new book and  sign copies at a 7:30 p.m. talk on Wednesday, January 31, at the  Capitola Book Cafe, 1475 41st Ave. Yung's book, Unbound Feet: A  Social History of Chinese Women in San Francisco (Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1995), was released in November in  both cloth ($45) and paper ($15.95). For information on the talk, call  (408) 462-4415.

For more than a thousand years foot-binding was an obligatory  practice for genteel women of China. Although bound feet marked  women as well-to-do members of society, the custom also  necessitated a cloistered and dependent life. Yung uses foot-binding  as a central theme to trace the stages of "unbinding" that took place  in the lives of Chinese women immigrants in San Francisco from the  late 1800s through the end of World War II.

Yung, an assistant professor of American studies at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, presents an engaging history by  supplementing factual information with case studies, profiles, and  oral histories of women who lived in those times. Her facts were  meticulously researched using U.S. census and immigration  documents, Chinese- and English-language newspapers, and oral  history. The text is complemented by more than 30 photos. Citing  such Chinese proverbs as, "The absence of talent in a woman is a  virtue," Yung follows the changes in lifestyles and identities that  occurred among the first immigrants and their daughters and later  immigrants.

Yung is also the author of Chinese Women of America: A  Pictorial History (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1986)  and, with Him Mark Lai and Genny Lim, Island: Poetry and History of  Chinese Immigrants on Angel Island, 1910-1940 (Seattle: University  of Washington Press, 1991), winner of the 1982 Before Columbus  Foundation Book Award.
