**Marc Mangel,** professor of conservation biology in the Department of Environmental Studies and the Institute of Marine Sciences, has been appointed as a visiting research professor at the Huxley School of Environment, Earth Sciences, and Engineering at Imperial College, London, England. His appointment will last for five years, during which he will spend one month per year in England, collaborating with faculty colleagues and graduate students.

Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine was founded in 1907 and has developed a strong reputation in the areas of science, engineering, and medicine. Beginning this year, the Huxley School has specialized in teaching and research about the evolution of the earth, the use of the earth's natural resources, and the study of human intervention in the environment. It has an academic staff of 85 and a student population of about 600.

"The appointment is very exciting for me," said Mangel. "We all recognize that some of the major problems of the next century will be related to the environment and natural resources. The Huxley School is taking the lead in finding solutions that require innovation at all levels--from basic science to engineering to policy."

Mangel noted that the merger of previously independent units of the center for environmental technology, and the departments of geology and earth resources engineering into one school offers "an exciting opportunity to create genuine interdisciplinary approaches to environmental problems, and I am very pleased to be involved."
