Professor of Italian and comparative literature **Margaret Brose** is the author of _Leopardi Sublime: La Poetica Della Temporalita_ (Re Enzo, 1998). The book is an analysis of the poetics of Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837), Italy's foremost Romantic poet. _Leopardi Sublime_ offers a rhetorical and stylistic examination of the lyrics, I Canti, and the prose dialogues of the poet.

Lecturer in writing **Ellen Hart** is coeditor of _Open Me Carefully: Emily Dickinson's Intimate Letters to Susan Huntington Dickinson_ (University of Maryland Press, 1998). The book presents a selection of letters and poems sent to Dickinson's primary correspondent, Susan Dickinson--her friend, sister-in-law, neighbor, and the recipient of more of the poet's writing than any other correspondent. This collection includes a number of writings not previously associated with Susan Dickinson, and is accompanied by biographical and historical commentary as well as physical descriptions of the documents and a discussion of new editing strategies.

Professor of linguistics **Sandra Chung** is the author of _The Design of Agreement: Evidence from Chamorro_ (University of Chicago Press, 1998). The book aims to separate the form of grammatical agreement from the syntax of grammatical agreement, drawing on evidence from Chamorro, an Austronesian language with an intricate agreement system. Chamorro is a living language, spoken on Guam and Saipan, and by many Guamanians on the West Coast of the U.S. Chung's book is considered to be the most detailed grammar to date of this understudied language.
