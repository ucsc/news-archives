SANTA CRUZ, CA--Coral reefs, beautiful barometers of the health of  the coastal environment, are in grave danger. Rapid human population  growth leading to pollution, development, overfishing, warming, and  other disturbances threaten to wipe out 20 to 30 percent of the  world's coral reefs by 2010, according to some estimates. Already,  civilization has degraded about 10 percent of all reefs.

To call attention to these issues, conservationists and marine  scientists designated 1997 as the International Year of the Coral  Reef. That designation heightens the focus on a global partnership to  protect and manage these irreplaceable resources: the International  Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI).

The University of California recently became ICRI's first  academic partner, joining about 50 nations and organizations.  Undersecretary Timothy Wirth of the U.S. State Department issued  the formal invitation to UC President Richard C. Atkinson. UC Santa  Cruz, home to a forefront group of marine researchers, will  coordinate UC's involvement in ICRI as the lead campus.

"Coral reefs are by far our richest marine ecosytems, but in  many ways we know so little about them," says Donald Potts,  professor of biology at UCSC. "Most of them are in shallow waters  near the shores of developing countries, which puts them at extreme  risk from the effects of massive population growth. Unless we  understand how reefs function as ecosystems, we will be in no  position to help developing societies use them sustainably."

Founded in December 1994, ICRI is implementing some of the  major goals of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment  and Development (UNCED). Delegates at UNCED concluded that the  most urgent environmental issues stem from growth in more than  100 developing countries around the world, mostly in the tropics.  ICRI aims to improve our scientific understanding of coral reefs,  thereby enhancing the economic and social development of tropical  societies that depend on reefs.

ICRI has served as a catalyst for researchers around the world  to cooperate on complex and interdisciplinary scientific, political,  and educational challenges related to coral reefs, Potts says. The  initiative focuses on reefs as vital resources to sustain, not just as  stunning tableaux to preserve.

Contrary to how it might appear, coral reefs are actually quite  resilient, says Potts, a longtime coral researcher. Many corals live  for centuries or even millennia, succumbing only to drastic events  such as hurricanes or changes in sea level. However, the sheer scale  of today's human-caused disturbances can overwhelm even the  hardiest reefs, he says. Foremost among these are sewage,  sediments, pesticides, and other runoff from development on land;  large-scale mining operations for cement and other reef-derived  building materials; intensive farming, especially of shrimp, that  harms reefs directly or destroys nearby mangrove swamps; and the  still poorly understood effects of long-term climate change.

For the partners in ICRI to promote a rational use of coral  reefs in developing countries, Potts says, they must have solid  scientific ground on which to stand. One of UC's primary roles in  ICRI, he notes, will be to bring the research strengths of its many  natural and social scientists to bear on several critical topics.  Among them are the following:

* The biodiversity of organisms that inhabit coral reefs. "We  need to know what species live there and study their basic  ecologies," Potts says. "We don't even know of the existence of most  of these organisms, much less anything about their roles in how the  ecosystems function."
* Learning more about how corals respond to stress, both  natural and unnatural. For instance, coral "bleaching," which occurs  when corals shed their resident algae, continues to spread widely.  Researchers still aren't sure about its root causes.
* Potential medicinal uses for the exotic chemicals contained  in the tissues of many plant and animal denizens of coral reefs.  Viewing reefs as watery pharmacies-in-waiting may help encourage  nations to preserve them.
* Studying corals as tracers of past climate changes. "Coral  skeletons retain isotopic and other signatures of the environment,"  Potts says. These valuable records may shed light on the likely fate  of the ocean as humans tinker with the planet's thermostat.

Further, Potts is enthusiastic about the budding collaborations  among natural scientists and social scientists throughout the UC  system on problems related to tropical countries. For example, UCSC  already has more than two dozen researchers who have worked in  Papua New Guinea--home to extensive and largely pristine reefs--on  issues ranging from marine biology, geology, and chemistry to  anthropology, environmental studies, and education. UC researchers  are eager to create similar multidisciplinary foci in other  developing regions, Potts believes.

Potts also hopes to draw upon the expertise of researchers at  neighboring institutions, such as the Monterey Bay Aquarium  Research Institute, California Academy of Sciences, Hopkins Marine  Station, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, and California State  University, Monterey Bay.
