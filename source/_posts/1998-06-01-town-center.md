Construction is anticipated to start this summer on a new building in downtown Santa Cruz. Dubbed "University Town Center," the building will house University Extension and approximately 100 UCSC and extension students. It will rise at the former site of Ford's Department Store on the corner of Pacific Avenue and Cathcart Street. Ford's was severely damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and was subsequently torn down.

The five-story building is expected to be completed by fall 1999. It will feature University Extension offices, a computer lab, and classrooms on a portion of the second floor and apartments for Extension foreign students and regularly enrolled UCSC students on the top two floors. The UC Regents, on behalf of UCSC, have signed a 10-year lease.

The ground floor, the third floor, and remaining space on the second floor will be leased as general retail, office, and commercial space.

The building is owned by Canfield, Laurel and Pacific, Limited Partnership, and Green Valley Corporation. Barry Swenson Builder is the developer on the project.
