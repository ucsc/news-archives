California Senator Bruce  McPherson will visit the UCSC campus on Friday, March 7, for a late-morning public meeting. The one-hour session, beginning at 11 a.m., will take place in the Red Room at College Eight.

During the meeting, Senator McPherson (R-Santa Cruz) will  present his perspective on the current legislative session, invite discussion of issues of concern to the campus, and take questions from the audience.

All members of the campus community are invited. Managers and supervisors are encouraged to provide release time to employees  to attend this event, based on operational considerations.

Senator McPherson, who represents the 15th District, was  recently appointed vice chair of the senate's Committee on Education. The 13-member committee hears all bills relating to K-12 education, higher education, and educational  personnel.

McPherson's visit to campus is cosponsored by the Academic Senate, the Staff Advisory Board, the Student Union Assembly, the Graduate Student Association, and the Chancellor's Office.
