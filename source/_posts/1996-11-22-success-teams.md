title: UC Santa Cruz Debuts New "Success Teams" To Help College-Bound Students

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Beginning this fall, college-bound students  seeking information about UC Santa Cruz can use the World Wide Web  to create their own personal "Success Team"--a group of UCSC  professionals dedicated to providing each student with guidance on  everything from deadlines to housing options.

Success Teams build a bridge to personal contact by using the  Web to introduce students to the UCSC staff members who will help  usher them through the admissions process--even the admissions  counselor who will read their application, if they decide to apply.  The program asks each student for basic information about his or her  background and interests, then creates a personalized "team,"  posting photos of staffers and providing team members' phone  numbers and e-mail addresses to make contact as friendly and easy  as possible.

Success Teams are one of the new services introduced this  year as part of the campus's "High-Tech for High Touch" campaign.  The idea is simple: Use World Wide Web-based technology to build on  UCSC's reputation as a campus that is friendly and supportive of  prospective and enrolled students. In addition to Success Teams,  UCSC has assumed a leading role in the "Pathways" project, the  University of California's electronic admissions option that is  available to prospective UC students at 58 participating high  schools statewide.

Although the idea of using technology to provide personalized  service may at first seem an oxymoron, the tools are convincing. The  Success Team concept was such a hit when it was introduced to high  school and community college counselors this past summer that  what had been planned as a pilot program was immediately put into  full gear.

"These new tools enable us to expand our outreach  dramatically and reach more students than ever before," says J. Michael Thompson, associate vice chancellor for enrollment  management and director of admissions at UCSC. "This won't  supplant our ongoing efforts--we'll still visit 350 schools this  year--but this enables us to make contact anywhere that there's Web  access. Enrolled students are encouraged to use the services, too."

"With this effort, we are building on UCSC's reputation as a  campus of innovation," says Thompson.
