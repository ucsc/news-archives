The Second Edition of _Plant Physiology_ by **Lincoln Taiz,** professor of biology at UCSC, and Eduardo Zeiger, professor of biology at UC Los Angeles, has just been published by Sinauer Associates of Sunderland, Mass. This new edition firmly establishes Taiz and Zeiger's book as the standard university-level textbook on plant physiology. It has already been widely adopted by colleges and universities throughout the United States.

As in the First Edition, published in 1991, the new edition features chapters by 21 contributing authors, each writing on his or her area of expertise. The idea behind this approach, said Taiz, was that plant physiology had grown to be such a diverse field that it was no longer possible for one or two people to cover all areas adequately.

Several new chapters were added to this edition, including ones on gene expression and signal transduction; growth, development, and differentiation; and blue-light responses. The contributing authors included some new faces, among them **Jane Silverthorne,** associate professor of biology, who wrote the chapter on phytochrome. Taiz wrote the introductory chapter, the chapter on gene expression and signal transduction, and parts of many other chapters.
