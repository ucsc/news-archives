SANTA CRUZ, CA--A dizzying array of organic plants will be  available at the annual UCSC Farm and Garden plant sale on Saturday  and Sunday, May 4-5, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The sale takes place at  the Barn Theater Parking Lot at the intersection of Bay and High  streets at the base of campus.

The plant sale features the widest selection of organically  raised container plants available in the Monterey Bay Area, says  UCSC Garden manager Orin Martin. All plants are proven to grow well  in the local area. "Varieties and timing are the key to successful  gardening," says Martin. "Once you've got the basic skills, you need to  plant the right thing at the right time, and you'll be set."

This year's selection has been expanded to more than 200  species of vegetables, flowers, landscape plants, ornamental  grasses, herbs, and "everlastings," or dried flowers. The Farm's  famous tree dahlias--pink and white--will be available again this  year, as will its trademark woolly lamb's ear.

Highlights of this year's vegetable selection include six-packs  of salad mix, lettuces, peppers, eggplant, broccoli, cauliflower, and  a sumptuous selection of tomatoes (including early girl, Oregon  spring, dona, green zebra, cherry, yellow taxi pear-shaped, and  golden and ruby pea-sized), and basils (including sweet, Thai,  cinnamon, anise, purple, and broadleaf).

The array of flowers includes a broad selection of lavenders,  salvias, yarrows, zinnias, and alstroemeria, as well as echinacea,  penstemon, statice, Shasta daisies, and lythrum. Stunning  sunflowers--including the multi-colored autumn beauty that  produces blooms in a range of shades from pale yellow to burnt  burgundy--will also be available. The Farm's roses are propagated  from cuttings, which produce hearty long-lived plants that bloom  profusely. Among this year's varieties are Buff Beauty, Will Scarlet,  Kentucky Derby, Bonica, Souleanna, Dr. Van Fleet, Mutabilis, and  Banksia lutea.

Sponsored by the Friends of the Farm and Garden, the sale will  benefit the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture. Members  of the Friends will receive a 10 percent discount on purchases;  memberships will be available at the sale.
