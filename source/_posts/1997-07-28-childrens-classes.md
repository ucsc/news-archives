SANTA CRUZ, CA--Longtime Salinas resident Helen Johnson has  sponsored a series of summer nature classes at the UC Santa Cruz  Arboretum for schoolchildren from the Salinas, Watsonville, and  Santa Cruz areas.

Johnson also has donated $1,000 to the Arboretum as seed  money to start the Helen Johnson UCSC Arboretum Junior Nature  Education Fund, which will allow the Arboretum to offer additional  children's classes in the future.

Fourteen students from Salinas rode a bus, chartered by  Johnson, to the first of the weeklong sets of classes in early July.  Johnson's donations also paid for the instructor and for supplies.  Participants toured the internationally renowned Arboretum, planted  their own small gardens, made paper, and learned about the area's  rich natural history, among other activities.

"I really want to help these children get interested in nature,"  said Johnson, who recalled that she was active in Earthwatch and  the University of California Research Expeditions programs. "If any  of them are captivated by what they learn, it just may help to  change their lives for the better."
