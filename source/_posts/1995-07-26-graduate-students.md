SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California, Santa Cruz, fared  remarkably well in a national competition for fellowships to support  graduate students in the sciences, garnering $1.3 million for the  1995-96 academic year.

The fellowships, from a U.S. Department of Education program  known as Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN),  will pay stipends, tuition, and fees for 55 students pursuing  doctoral degrees in biology, chemistry, computer and information  sciences, mathematics, or physics. The fellowships, which last for  three years, exist to "sustain and enhance the capacity for teaching  and research in areas of national need."

Each recipient will earn a $14,400 stipend and $9,493 to cover  tuition and other costs. The fellowships are available to all graduate  students in the five fields, with an emphasis on supporting women  as well as African American, American Indian, Chicano, and Latino  students.

In the fall of 1994, those minorities made up 14.2 percent of  UCSC's graduate student body. That was the highest percentage in  the UC system, says Ronaldo Ramirez, assistant to the dean of the  Division of Graduate Studies. "The faculty and facilities are what  attracts a number of talented students, and it helps when we are  able to offer competitive financial packages," Ramirez says.

Ramirez applied for the grants and serves as project  codirector, along with the chairs of the five departments. Each  department will receive $167,251 for the 1995-96 academic year to  support seven graduate students. In addition, two departments will  receive renewals of GAANN grants awarded last year: $262,923 to  biology (eleven students) and $215,037 to physics (nine students).

"These fellowships are prestigious for the recipients, and they  have many positive spillover effects," Ramirez says. "For instance,  they will free up teaching assistantships and other sources of  support for other students who need them." Ramirez adds that the  fellowships also help assistant professors, who often lack the  external grants necessary to support the research of many graduate  students in their labs.

UCSC received 5 of the 70 new GAANN grants awarded this  year. The Department of Education received 285 applications for the  1995-96 funds, which totaled $11 million.
