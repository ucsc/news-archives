FULL TIME/CAREER
SALARY COMMENSURATE WITH QUALIFICATIONS & EXPERIENCE

The University of California, Santa Cruz invites applications and nominations for the position of Vice Chancellor - University Relations.  This is an outstanding career opportunity for an individual seeking a key leadership role in a rapidly developing research university.   Reporting to the Chancellor, the Vice Chancellor - University Relations will provide leadership in fund raising, including the implementation of major capital campaigns, in developing effective alumni, public and governmental relations and synergistic working relationships with the campus leadership and the UCSC Foundation, and in building effective liaison with colleagues in research and public information.

Founded in 1965, UCSC is recognized as one of the rising public universities in the country, distinguished for combining devotion to teaching excellence and innovation with renowned strengths in scholarship and research.   Several new research and teaching initiatives are underway, and in fall 1997, the campus launched the Jack Baskin School of Engineering, with major gift support. UCSC plans growth to at least 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students, from a current enrollment of 10,600, and toward this goal, is actively building partnerships throughout the Silicon Valley, Monterey Bay area and beyond.    UCSC is nestled within 2,000 acres of redwood forest and meadows, overlooking the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary of California's beautiful Central Coast, about 70 miles from San Francisco and 30 miles from the Silicon Valley.

Within this context, UC Santa Cruz seeks an exceptional individual with significant leadership experience in development, alumni relations, public relations, and state or national legislative relations experience, strong management experience, and creativity and enthusiasm to expand a diverse university relations program.  Key requirements for this position include a successful track record in major gift and campaign fund raising, thorough understanding of higher education in the context of a research university, outstanding ability to articulate UCSC's needs and goals in order to advance the campus' commitment to excellence in teaching and research, and demonstrated ability to interact productively with faculty, administrators, and community members in developing and leading dynamic university relations programs.   The University of California has a strong commitment to the goals and practices of equal opportunity; UCSC seeks an individual who shares that commitment.
