SANTA CRUZ, CA--Two professors at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, were among those named to receive the prestigious  National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grants, which were  announced today (Monday, August 22).

Edmund Burke III, a professor of history, received a grant of  $197,000 in support of an institute titled, "Rethinking  Europe/Rethinking World History, 1500-1750." Murray Baumgarten, a  professor of English and comparative literature, received a grant of  $73,115 for a seminar titled, "Reading Our Mutual Friend: Charles  Dickens and Serial Production." Both the institute and the seminar  will be held during the summer of 1995.

Burke's grant will bring 25 college and university historians to  the campus for six weeks next summer to discuss new approaches to  teaching world history. The seminar, Burke says, is intended to  encourage participants to develop a more global understanding of the  emergence of the modern world, linking new knowledge about Europe,  Africa, Asia, and the Americas.

Despite an increasing awareness of the significance of the role  played in history by non-European countries, and an increasing  demand by our ethnically diverse population for a more inclusive  historical perspective, Burke says, "no one is being trained to teach  such courses."

"The goal of the institute is to develop a new understanding  about the ways in which the roots of modern Europe and those of the  modern world are inseparably linked, and to discover strategies that  will lead teachers of history and the humanities to be more aware of  the ways in which specific regional histories can be enriched and  disciplined through the application of a global perspective," he  explains.

Burke's fields of study are Middle Eastern and European history.  He has written and edited publications on Middle Eastern social  history, European orientalism, and world history.

Baumgarten's five-week seminar will bring together some 25  high school and community college teachers from around the country  to read Dickens's last complete novel in serial installments-- as it was originally published. The group will also study the cultural  and political context of the work.

"Dickens pioneered the method of serial publications, and all  the great Victorian novels were published in serials. We can  experience some of the suspense and discovery the Victorians did in  reading these novels," Baumgarten says, noting that some  instructors now teach Dickens in serial parts.

The seminar will be presented under the auspices of the  Dickens Project. Baumgarten, who came to UCSC in 1966, is the  founding director of the Dickens Project and has written on Dickens  and other Victorian authors. He is also editor in chief of the Strouse  Carlyle Edition.

The NEH is an independent federal agency supporting research,  education, preservation projects, and public programs in the  humanities. The 307 recipients for this quarter received grants  totaling more than $29.6 million.
