SANTA CRUZ, CA--Two internationally known researchers,  seismologist Thorne Lay and astronomer Joseph Miller, have received  "Outstanding Faculty Awards" for 1996-97 from their peers in the  Division of Natural Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.

The award, first bestowed in 1993, honors excellence in three  areas: research, teaching, and service to the campus, scientific  organizations, and the public.

Lay, chairman of UCSC's Earth Sciences Department, is noted  for far-reaching research in three main areas: deep structure within  the planet, especially at the boundary between Earth's mantle and its  core; the rupture process and slip distribution in large earthquakes;  and seismic monitoring of nuclear tests. The American Geophysical  Union recognized Lay as one of the country's top young geophysicists  by awarding him its prestigious Macelwane Medal in 1991.

Lay has chaired two panels convened by the National Research  Council to examine scientific issues related to the global  Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He also is one of the principal  architects of the National Science Foundation's new program for  Studies of the Earth's Deep Interior.

Lay received his Ph.D. from the California Institute of  Technology in 1983. He was at the University of Michigan before  joining UCSC's faculty in 1989 to direct the campus's Institute of  Tectonics. In 1992 he received a Favorite Professor Award from  UCSC's Student Alumni Council.

Miller is director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory, which  oversees Lick Observatory near San Jose and the UC share of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. His most pioneering research  concerns the nature of quasars and the centers of active galaxies.  Miller also is known for his work in developing sophisticated  observing tools for large telescopes, such as the secondary mirrors  for the Keck I and Keck II Telescopes and a spectrograph for Keck II,  now being built at UCSC.

Miller was assistant director of Lick Observatory for 10 years  before becoming director in 1991. He has served on several national  committees to advise observatories, including a term as chairman of  the AURA Coordinating Council of Observatory Research Directors.

Miller earned his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin in  1967 and came to UCSC that year. Many of his doctoral students have  gone on to become leaders in their fields. In addition, Miller teaches  one of UCSC's most popular undergraduate courses, Overview of the  Universe.
