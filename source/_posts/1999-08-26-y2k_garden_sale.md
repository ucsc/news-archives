## Shop For Your Y2k Garden At UCSC's Fall Plant Sale

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Forget about bank statements, bottled water, and other Y2K preparations, because what you'll really need for the new millennium is a healthy garden. Whether you're starting from scratch or planting for the 21st century, you'll find what you need at the UC Santa Cruz annual Fall Plant Sale on Friday and Saturday, September 17 and 18. Hours are noon to 6 p.m. on Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. The sale will take place in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High Streets at the base of campus.

Our mild climate is ideal for winter gardens, and Orin Martin, manager of UCSC's Alan Chadwick Garden, says gardeners who plant perennials in the fall are several steps ahead in the spring when established plants can really take off as the air and soil warm up.

This year's selection will feature the usual impressive array of vegetable six-packs, including salad mix, lettuce, peas, chard, broccoli, leeks, kale, bunch onions, and culinary herbs. For perennial lovers, there will be roses in gallon containers, lavender, subtropical salvias, and ornamental grasses. Herbaceous perennials like yarrow and delphinium will be available, as will a smattering of California natives, including blue- and yellow-eyed grass, and native currants. All plants are organically grown at the UC Santa Cruz Farm & Garden.

Fall planting can't be beat, said Martin, because warm soil, mild weather, and relatively long days give perennials a chance to become established. Vegetables like lettuce that are planted now will produce for one to two months during the winter, compared to the typical two- or three-week summer harvest period, noted Martin.

Sponsored by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, the sale will benefit the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture. Members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden will receive a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available at the sale.
