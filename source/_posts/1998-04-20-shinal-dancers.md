![\[Photo of Su-Nu-Nu Shinal dancers\]][1] An audience gathered at Porter College Quad under last Thursday's sunny skies for a performance of traditional dance by Su-Nu-Nu Shinal, Pomo Indian dancers. The troupe traveled from the Mendocino area to perform for UCSC students, faculty, staff, and children from the UCSC Children's Center. The performance was organized by theater arts student Carie Warner and was sponsored by EOP, Porter College, Student Affairs, and Re-Entry Services.
