title: UC Santa Cruz Workshop To Demonstrate Latest Composting Techniques

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A free demonstration of on-farm composting  techniques will take place at the Herbert Ranch in Hollister on  Wednesday, May 3, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.

The demonstration is tied to a two-year effort to reduce the  volume of organic materials going into increasingly overloaded  landfills. Cities and counties are working with farmers to turn these  materials into a valuable soil additive through on-farm or municipal  composting. The project is coordinated by Marc Buchanan, assistant  professor of environmental studies at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, and funded by the California Integrated Waste  Management Board (CIWMB).

At the May 3 demonstration, Buchanan will team up with Pat  Herbert, a collaborator on the project and an organic vegetable  grower; grower Phil Foster; and Paul Rellis of the CIWMB to discuss  access farmers have to raw materials needed for compost, including  materials from municipal sources.

Other topics will include tips on building and monitoring the  compost pile, a presentation on the latest equipment for compost  production, and a discussion of growers' experiences making and  using compost. Discussion leaders include UC Cooperative Extension  farm adviser Richard Smith and George Leidig of Autrusa Compost  Consulting.

The Monterey Bay region, with its abundance of farms and  urban areas, offers an ideal setting for municipal and on-farm  composting efforts, said Buchanan. Fifteen to 25 percent of  municipal waste streams in California are made up of materials that  could be converted to compost.

To reach the Herbert ranch, follow Highway 156 north from  Hollister to Highway 25. Take Highway 25 two miles to McConnel  Road. Make a left onto McConnel Road, and follow signs to the Field  Day site. The event is sponsored by UCSC, the CIWMB Compost  Demonstration Project, and the Community Alliance with Family  Farmers Foundation's Lighthouse Farm Campaign.
