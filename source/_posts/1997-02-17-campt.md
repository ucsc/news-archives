Assistant Professor of Women's Studies

Tina Campt studies the history of Afro-Germans, and Afro-German women in particular. Her work focuses on the period of the Third Reich. She is also interested in questions of identity formation and the ways in which studying the history of Afro-Germans opens up new perspectives on the history of National Socialism. Campt comes to UCSC from the Technical University of Berlin where she taught for the past three years. She earned a B.A. in history from Vassar College and her M.A. and Ph.D. in German history from Cornell University.
