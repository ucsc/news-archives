**Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood** discussed her selection as president-elect of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in the national biweekly newspaper _The Scientist, _as well as in "Reuters Health," a daily online news service for physicians.

Founding Crown College provost and famed botanist **Kenneth Thimann,** who died on January 15 at age 92, was the subject of a sizable obituary in the _New York Times._ Several other newspapers also published appreciations of his career, including the _Boston Globe, San Jose_ _Mercury News,_ and _Santa Cruz County Sentinel._ The latter, a front-page article, featured reminiscences about Thimann from fellow biologists **Harry Beevers** and **Jean Langenheim,** as well as touching comments from UCSC's founding chancellor **Dean McHenry,** who convinced Thimann to leave Harvard for UCSC in 1965.

Psychology's **Bruce Bridgeman** was a guest on Eileen Sundat's two-hour program "Sunset Salon" on KSCO radio in January, discussing the worldwide overpopulation crisis.

Attention continues for the innovative research of geophysicists **Ed Garnero** and **Quentin Williams,** who are exploring the properties of a layer of partially molten rock at the base of the planet's mantle. The latest publicity: a four-page article in the February 1997 issue of the national magazine _Earth._

KSCO radio called astronomer **George Blumenthal** to discuss an international study that ranked UCSC's Astronomy and Astrophysics Department among the best in the world. The study also earned mention on KGO radio and in the_ San Jose Mercury News._

Undergraduate **Devon Maitozo,** a theater arts major who won the bronze medal in vaulting at the 1996 World Championships in Hungary, told the _San Jose Mercury News_ in a profile that it's sometimes "a little frustrating" to be the best in a little-known sport. Vaulting is a sport in which competitors execute gymnastics and acrobatic moves on horseback. Maitozo wants to push vaulting in the direction of theater, making it more like figure skating.
