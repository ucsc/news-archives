SANTA CRUZ, CA--Four scholars from the University of California,  Santa Cruz, who have recently published books exploring aspects of  the environment and environmental politics will gather for a talk  and booksigning on Tuesday, March 21, at 7:30 p.m. at the Capitola  Book Cafe, 1475 41st Ave.

The talk, titled "Changing Views of Politics, Science, and the  Environment," features Ed Grumbine, Gary Lease, Daniel Press, and  Michael Soule of the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Gary Lease and Michael Soule are the editors of Reinventing  Nature? Responses to Postmodern Deconstruction (Washington, D.C.,  and Covelo, Calif.: Island Press, 1995)--a collection of essays  addressing conflicting perceptions of nature and their influences on  such policy issues as land management, hunting regulation, and  habitat protection. Lease is a professor of history of consciousness  and dean of the Division of Humanities at UCSC. He served for three  years as chair of UCSC's Environmental Studies Board. Michael Soule  is professor and current chair of environmental studies. He is  founding president of the Society for Conservation Biology and a  fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Ed Grumbine is the author of Environmental Policy and  Biodiversity (Island Press, 1994), which is written to present  recent developments in the field of conservation science to  environmental policy makers and to explain the environmental  decision-making process to scientists. He is the director of the  Sierra Institute at UC Extension and has written frequently on  federal land-management issues. He is best known for his book Ghost  Bears: Exploring the Biodiversity Crisis (Island Press, 1992).

Daniel Press is the author of Democratic Dilemmas in the Age  of Ecology: Trees and Toxics in the American West (Durham, N.C.:  Duke University Press, 1994), an exploration of the dynamic between  the democratic decision-making process and the management of  environmental crises. An assistant professor of environmental  studies, Press teaches environmental politics and policy, law, and  ethics.

The day before their booksigning, Grumbine, Lease, Press, and  Soule will participate in a panel discussion on KUSP radio 88.9 FM.  The talk takes place from noon to 1 p.m. on Monday, March 20, on  KUSP's Radiogram with host Eric Schoeck.
