title: New Technique Paints Picture Of Tectonic Plates Plunging Beneath Mountains In Southern California

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Using the waves from earthquakes as sonar-like  "pings" to probe below the earth's crust, a seismologist has learned  surprising new details about giant slabs of rock that dive into the  planet at the roots of southern California's dramatic Transverse  Ranges.

The study seems to verify what researchers suspected: A kink  in the San Andreas fault near Los Angeles forces parts of two  tectonic plates to collide and plummet nearly straight down.  Evidence suggests that one of these slabs, the Pacific plate, is  sheared and rended apart as it dives, thanks to severe stresses  created by the bend in the fault. But the other slab, the North  American plate, appears thicker and more mature. The stresses  disrupt the plate much less severely during its vertical journey.

These findings do not significantly change estimates of  earthquake hazard in the region. However, the imaging technique  does offer seismologists a new way to explore the inner workings of  slabs, which cause some of the world's largest quakes as they sink  into the earth. Other methods can locate these slabs, but only as  undefined blobs of cold rock; the new method begins to see  structures within the blobs that previously escaped notice.

"The best analogy is the device that hangs off a boat to scan  for fish in the water," says author Justin Revenaugh, assistant  professor of earth sciences at the University of California, Santa  Cruz. "Earthquakes send out a complex ping, and that ping scatters  off changes in material properties at various depths in the earth.  Instruments at the surface pick up the echoes. This technique  reveals small-scale features that other methods just can't see."

Revenaugh, a member of the Crustal Imaging Laboratory at the  UC Santa Cruz Institute of Tectonics, published his work in the June 30 issue of the journal Science.

Looming over the study site are the Transverse Ranges, which  Revenaugh calls "some of the most spectacular topography in North  America." Marching east from the sea near Santa Barbara, the  mountain ranges stretch past L.A., San Bernardino, and into the  Joshua Tree National Monument. They include the Santa Ynez  Mountains, San Bernardino Mountains, and the San Gabriel Mountains,  which soar so abruptly north of Los Angeles.

Unlike most other coastal mountain ranges in California, which  mirror the northwest-trending San Andreas fault, these mountains  run east to west--transverse to the rest. The culprit is a sweeping  20-degree bend in the San Andreas. The bend makes it impossible for  the Pacific and North American plates to simply lurch past each  other, as they do elsewhere. Rather, the uppermost part of the  planet, the crust, gets twisted and piled up as it careens (in geologic  time) around the curve.

"There are bends in other strike-slip faults, but this is far and  away the largest," Revenaugh says. "The result is that these are  among the fastest growing mountains in the world." The mountains  also crumble quickly, he notes, in a classic competition between  tectonics and erosion.

Earth's crust is brittle, so it fractures as it gets compressed  in the bend. The fractures trigger events such as the 1994  Northridge earthquake. But below the crust in the upper mantle, rock  tends to flow, not break. Because of the bend, the bottom parts of  the Pacific and North American plates can't flow past each other.  Instead, they sink in the process known as subduction.

Seismologists see the subduction by charting the speeds of  seismic waves, which travel faster through cold rock. As a slab  subducts, it stays colder than the mantle around it for millions of  years. Beneath the Transverse Ranges, some seismic waves move 3.5 percent faster, implying rocks colder by about 1,000 degrees F.  However, this method--called seismic tomography--cannot discern  features inside the slab, which is about 40 miles wide.

To get finer resolution, Revenaugh adapted a technique that  researchers have used to monitor nuclear tests. It models the upper  part of the earth as a swarm of points that scatter energy, like fish  in the water scatter sonar. Quakes from across the globe send waves  through the swarm. Seismographs receive the echoes; their intensity  and timing tells Revenaugh which points scatter most strongly.  Pronounced scattering means that some abrupt change in the earth  exists at that point. The technique unmasks those blips at a scale of  a mile or two.

Revenaugh's data encompassed 120 Pacific Rim quakes from  1980 to 1993, measured by 232 stations in the Southern California  Seismographic Network. He saw a lot of seismic energy scattered  from the southern part of the slab under the Transverse Ranges,  corresponding to the Pacific plate. This was most clear at depths  between 50 and 125 miles.

The scattering, Revenaugh believes, arises when cold parts of  the slab are exposed to the warmer mantle relatively quickly. That  would happen if the slab gets disrupted on its way down by the  tortured stresses imposed by the sinuous fault at the surface. Like a  sliced-and-diced sausage with a hot middle, cold and warm bits of  slab would mingle, reflecting seismic waves.

Strikingly, the northern part of the slab, the remnants of the  North American plate, scattered virtually no energy. Revenaugh  offers a theory: "The Pacific plate moves through the Salton Sea  area, where there is hot material ascending from the mantle. That  warms up the plate and rejuvenates it, effectively making it thinner.  When it goes down, it's easier to shear that plate and mess it up." In  contrast, the North American plate seems colder and thicker, so  tectonic shearing does not expose its inner layers to the warm  mantle. As a result, the temperature contrasts are much less severe.

Revenaugh hopes to extend his technique to other fault areas  and to refine it by using different types of seismic waves for his  analysis.
