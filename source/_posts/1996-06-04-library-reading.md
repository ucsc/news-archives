SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Friends of the UCSC Library invite the public  to celebrate the group's 30th year in a gathering that will feature  poetry readings, refreshments, and general good cheer. The meeting  takes place on Thursday, June 13, at 4 p.m. under the cherry trees  outside McHenry Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

In continuing the Friends' tradition of celebrating poetry, this  special thirtieth anniversary program showcases the work of UCSC  students. Readers will include a number of the talented students  whose poems were selected for inclusion in the latest issue of  Chinquapin--a literary magazine featuring the writing and art of  UCSC students, alumni, faculty, and staff.

The moderator for the program is assistant professor of  literature Peter Gizzi, a rising young poet and printer and recipient  of the 1994 Lavan Younger Poets Award from the Academy of  American Poets. Gizzi has served this year as mentor to the  dedicated young staff of Chinquapin.

The gathering, which includes a brief business meeting to  elect new members of the Friends Board of Directors, is free and  open to the public. For more information, call (408) 459-3381.
