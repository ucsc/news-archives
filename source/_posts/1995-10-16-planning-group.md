SANTA CRUZ, CA--Carrol Moran, an education specialist with more  than twenty years of experience in the Monterey Bay Area, has been  named coordinator of the Monterey Bay Educational Consortium.  Moran's appointment was announced today (Monday, October 16,  1995) by UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Karl S. Pister. Moran will oversee  educational collaborations between the University of California,  Santa Cruz, and public schools. Her appointment took effect October  2\.

"The university must be an active partner in education at all  levels, and I am committed to sharing the resources of the  university with K-12 education," said Pister. "As these collaborative  relationships multiply, the consortium will allow us to focus our  efforts and maximize our effectiveness." More than 60  collaborations exist between UCSC and public schools, including 23  partnerships in math and science.

The consortium was established in early 1994 to encourage  collaborations among UC Santa Cruz, public school districts, and  other educational groups in the Monterey Bay Area. Founding  members are UCSC, the Pajaro Valley Unified School District, Santa  Cruz City Schools, the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District,  and the Santa Cruz County Office of Education.

The consortium, governed by a round table made up of the  leaders of the member institutions, is dedicated to improving  curriculum, policy, and the public's understanding and support of  public education. "The consortium will bring together a cross section  of the educational agencies in the Monterey Bay Area to tackle the  big issues in education," said Moran. "It is a way to organize around  common goals that will enable us to share resources and have a  stronger impact."

Chancellor Pister provided seed money to fund the coordinator  position. Moran, a graduate of UCSC, is finishing up her doctorate in  language, literacy, and culture at Stanford University. Her  experience includes a lengthy affiliation with the Pajaro Valley  Unified School District, where she has worked as a bilingual teacher,  resource teacher, mentor teacher, language and reading specialist,  and staff development coordinator. She has also taught in the  education departments at San Jose State University and Stanford  University. She is the author of numerous teaching guides and has  extensive experience working with culturally diverse students.
