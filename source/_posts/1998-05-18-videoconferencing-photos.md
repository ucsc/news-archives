![\[Photo of Chancellor Greenwood in videoconferencing classroom\]][1] Chancellor Greenwood demonstrated the facility's long-range communication capabilities by discussing the project with Craig Broadway, who took the call in Connecticut. Broadway is CEO of AVAI, Inc., the company that developed the software for the videoconferencing classroom.

![\[Photo of Francisco Hernandez at videoconferencing terminal\]][3] Vice Chancellor Francisco Hernandez said the videoconferencing room--and facilities like it--could be a useful tool in the campus's outreach efforts. A "virtual" high school, he added, could help level the playing field for California high school students who don't otherwise have access to courses the university requires for admission.
