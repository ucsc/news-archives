SANTA CRUZ, CA--Public educators at Long Marine Lab invite  community members with an interest in marine science to join an  upcoming training course for volunteer docents. The two-month  series of classes begins on Monday, January 8.

Docents spend at least six hours a month teaching the public  and schoolchildren about the Monterey Bay environment and marine  research at Long Marine Lab. Operated by UC Santa Cruz, the lab  attracts about 40,000 visitors each year for tours and educational  programs.

The course offers training in interpretive skills and basic  marine biology, along with informative presentations on current  research projects. Docents must have time to work on either  weekday mornings or weekend afternoons.

Classes will occur on Monday and Wednesday evenings in  January and February, followed by a three-week apprenticeship.  Space is limited in the training course, which costs $35. Applicants  may contact the lab's Education Office at 459-3854 for more  information.
