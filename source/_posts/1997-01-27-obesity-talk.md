SANTA CRUZ, CA--UC Santa Cruz Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood will  discuss the questions "If Thin Is In, Why Are So Many People So  Fat?--Obesity: Bad Genes or Bad Behavior?" from 7 to 8 p.m. on  Thursday, February 13, at the Museum of Art and History at the  McPherson Center, 705 Front Street, Santa Cruz. The talk is free and  open to the public. A reception follows.

Greenwood, professor of biology and a well-known researcher  in the field of obesity, is February's featured speaker in the  Humanities Lecture Series. The series is presented jointly by UCSC's  Humanities Division and the Museum of Art and History.

In the last two decades, nutrition experts have advised the  public to eat less fat, cut calories, and exercise more. Supermarket  shelves now overflow with low-fat foods. Yet national health  surveys reveal that since 1980, the percentage of overweight  Americans has increased markedly. The latest statistics show that  31 percent of all men and 35 percent of all women over the age of 20  are overweight. Why?

Last year, scientists discovered a molecular signaling  mechanism between the body's fat stores and the brain that may  determine a person's body weight. Researchers are now trying to  grasp how leptin, a newly exposed messenger molecule that carries  out this signaling, apparently helps to regulate body weight to  within fairly narrow limits over the course of a lifetime. Greenwood  will discuss the impacts of these recent findings, which have made  scientists optimistic that they may uncover biological answers to  this complex problem.

For 25 years, Greenwood has headed and participated in  research teams that have examined the complex interplay among  metabolism, development, behavior, and genetics that can lead to  obesity. Greenwood received her Ph.D. in physiology, developmental  biology, and neurosciences from Rockefeller University. She has held  faculty positions at Columbia University and Vassar College, where  she chaired the Biology Department. She has served as director of  the NIH Obesity Research Center Animal Model CORE Laboratory,  president of the North American Association for the Study of  Obesity, and chair of the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of  Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. She currently is vice  president of the American Society for Clinical Nutrition.

Greenwood has held the position of UCSC chancellor since July 1, 1996, following seven years at UC Davis as dean of graduate  studies and professor of nutrition and internal medicine. From  November 1993 to May 1995, Greenwood served as associate  director for science in the White House Office of Science and  Technology Policy. She was recently chosen president-elect of the  American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's  largest general science organization. President Clinton also has  nominated Greenwood to the National Science Board, a 24-member  panel that advises on policies for science research and education.
