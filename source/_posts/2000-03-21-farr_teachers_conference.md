## Sam Farr Attends Third Annual Teachers Conference April 1

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Congressman Sam Farr will be the guest speaker at the third annual spring conference for Monterey Bay teachers and educators on Saturday, April 1. The event, "Setting the Standard in Science Education: A Celebration of Science Education," takes place from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Hartnell College in Salinas.

With funding from the National Science Foundation, the conference is being sponsored by the Life Lab Science Program and the University of California, Santa Cruz. Advance registration is required; the cost is $25. To register or for more information, call Life Lab at (831) 459- 2001.

The conference will showcase the work of educators who have been participating in Life Lab's five-year LASERS project, the Language Acquisition in Science Education in Rural Schools program. The goal of LASERS has been to enhance science education for bilingual children while helping youngsters develop their English skills. Twenty workshops throughout the day will cover subjects that range from practical classroom tips on activities that stimulate science learning to broader discussion of changes in the science curriculum.

In addition to making welcoming remarks and speaking about the importance of science education in schools today, Farr will conduct a workshop on the federal government and education.

The keynote speaker will be Dr. Eric Jolly, senior scientist and vice president of the Education Development Center in Boston, who will deliver a talk entitled, "Weaving Meaning into Curriculum: Connecting Scientific and Community Knowledge Systems." An accomplished basket maker, Jolly will use the weaving tradition of his Cherokee heritage as a metaphor as he encourages teachers to make classroom activities more engaging for all students and discusses the importance of connecting education with a student's culture.
