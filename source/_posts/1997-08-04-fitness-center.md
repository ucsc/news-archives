title: New Fitness Center To Have Windows With A View

Users of UCSC's planned $3.6-million fitness center will have a grand view of the Monterey Bay to take their minds off their workouts.

The fitness center will be located just south of the tennis courts in the East Field area. The siting was based on a recommendation from a committee made up of students, faculty, staff, and UCSC neighbors.

The south location was approved by the campus Design Advisory Board in late spring quarter, said Dan Wood, director of the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports (OPERS).

Tucked between the courts and a knoll on the meadow, the 10,600-square-foot building will feature expansive views of the Monterey Bay from its second-story south- and east-facing windows. Construction is expected to start in summer 1998 and be finished approximately a year later, said Wood.

"It's a beautiful location, and it's going to be a very enjoyable environment to improve one's health and to have the campus community come together for positive socialization," he said. "We expect it to be a very popular place."

Environmental review of the project is currently under way, said Wood, and an environmental impact report will be prepared. The issues to be addressed in the review process include geology, soils and seismicity, historical and archaeological resources, visual quality, noise, and parking.

The site is currently a field area where cars are occasionally parked for large events, said Wood.

Students voted to fund the construction and maintenance of the fitness and weight-training center in the spring 1996 student elections. When complete, the center will offer state-of-the-art exercise equipment, including stairclimbers, weight machines, and treadmills. Design is under way to determine how the interior of the building will be used by OPERS programs.

OPERS plans to hold a public meeting in the fall to update the UCSC and Santa Cruz communities on the progress of the environmental review. For more information, call (408) 459-2531.
