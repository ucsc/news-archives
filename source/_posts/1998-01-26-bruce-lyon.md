His recent work has explored social signals and patterns of cooperation and reproductive parasitism in birds and insects. Lyon received his B.S. from McGill University, his M.S. from Queen's University, and his Ph.D. from Princeton. He worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto and the University of Calgary.
