Interested in statistics like the percent of Santa Cruzans that work out of county? The educational levels of county adults compared to the rest of the state? The percentage of local 6th graders that tried alcohol last year? How long on average it takes for police to respond to emergencies in various county locations? The Year Three edition of the United Way's "Comprehensive Community Assessment Report--Life in Santa Cruz County" is out. University Librarian **Allan Dyson** and EVC **R. Michael Tanner** served on the project's Steering Committee. The fascinating 280-page report includes data on economic, education, health, public safety and social-environment issues, and is available from the United Way Office at 1220 41st Avenue, Capitola 95010 (phone (408) 479-5466).
