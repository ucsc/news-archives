Romney Dunbar of KSBW-TV covered a visit to the **UCSC Farm and Garden** by seven farmers participating in an international exchange program.  ([Photo][2]) Hailing from Honduras, Lithuania, and Russia, the farmers spent a day at UCSC learning about sustainable agriculture. KSCO radio also covered the visit.   

Sociologist **Andrew Szasz** was featured in _West_, the Sunday magazine published by the _San Jose Mercury News_, for his work on the distribution of toxic wastes in Santa Clara County. Szasz is one of the first researchers in the country to use federal inventories of toxics in this way.  

The new **Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope** at Lick Observatory, for which UCSC played a critical role in raising funds, received widespread attention following its recent dedication. _Nature_, the _Journal of College Science Teaching_, the _San Francisco Chronicle_, and the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ all took note, as did the _San Jose Mercury News_, which ran a photo of the telescope's creator, **Alex Filippenko** of UC Berkeley. _Astronomy_ plans an article as well in a forthcoming issue.

Psychologist **Barry McLaughlin** was quoted at length in a package of stories about bilingual education that appeared in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_. Also in psychology, **Tom Pettigrew** was quoted in a pre-election _San Francisco Examiner_ story about Proposition 209, saying that the wording of the ballot initiative--which omitted the words "affirmative action"--greatly enhanced its chances of passage.
