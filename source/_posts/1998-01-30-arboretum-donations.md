SANTA CRUZ, CA--Two longtime supporters of the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum  who have recently given gifts totaling $750,000 will be honored at a private  reception with Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood on Saturday, January 31.

Santa Fe resident Elspeth Bobbs gave $500,000 to establish the Ray  Collett Arboretum Endowment to help support the facility's general operating  expenses. The campus and community have been challenged to match the gift,  which honors Collett, founding director of the Arboretum.

A second gift to the Arboretum, made by Santa Cruz resident Barbara  Shields in late December, has taken the campus halfway toward that matching  goal. A lifelong gardening enthusiast and highly recognized watercolorist,  Shields has established a charitable trust with a gift of $250,000, which will  also support general operating expenses.

The premier botanical garden in the Monterey Bay Area, the UCSC  Arboretum features an extensive collection of plants from Australia, New  Zealand, and South Africa, as well as a California native plant garden and the  most complete collection of conifers in the world.

The gifts come at a time of transition for the Arboretum. Collett  stepped down on January 1 after more than 30 years of service to the  campus's botanical collection. He and dozens of volunteer supporters of the  Arboretum will be honored at the reception on January 31 at Greenwood's  campus home. Collett has been named the Arboretum's director emeritus and  will retain his faculty position as professor of natural sciences. He will  maintain an active teaching schedule.

"The Arboretum encompasses the wonderful collection that it does  because of Ray Collett's foresight, skill, and hard work. He deserves our admiration and thanks for his  many years of dedication," said Chancellor Greenwood. "These generous gifts  will provide a tremendous boost to the Arboretum. I hope our dedicated  Arboretum friends will help us meet Mrs. Bobbs's challenge."

Last week, Ron Enomoto was named interim director of the Arboretum, a  post he will hold for 18 months. He will work with campus advisors, faculty,  and Arboretum staff and volunteers  to implement a transition plan for the Arboretum.
