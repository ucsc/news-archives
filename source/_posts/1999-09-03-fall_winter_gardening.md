## Learn Fall And Winter Gardening Tips At UC Santa Cruz

SANTA CRUZ, CA--With a little preparation, Central Coast gardeners can harvest food from their gardens all year-round. Learn how to prepare your garden for fall and winter at a three-hour workshop at UC Santa Cruz on Saturday, September 18, from noon to 3 p.m. The class will take place at the Louise Cain Gatehouse at the UCSC Farm.

Topics will include:

* variety selection and planting times for the best-performing fall and winter vegetable and fruit crops
* seasonal care of the soil, including mulches and cover crops
* a demonstration of direct sowing and transplanting techniques

The cost of the class is $10 for the general public; $5 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden. Proceeds benefit the public education and outreach work of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.

The Farm is located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available across the street from the Blacksmith Shop in the Physical Plant parking lot.
