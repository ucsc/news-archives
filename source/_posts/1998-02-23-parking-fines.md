title: Parking Fines

Because the availability of parking spaces on campus is limited, the University Police Department is increasing parking enforcement.

A recent survey showed that the majority of people receiving parking citations on campus either have no permit, have a permit which is not valid in the lot where their vehicle is parked, or are parked at an expired meter. Effective March 1, 1998, the fine for each of these violations will be increased to $25.

We hope that this increased fine will discourage people from taking spaces that they are not entitled to use.

The Police Department also encourages campus members to use alternate forms of transportation, including the Metro bus, campus shuttle system, car-pooling, and bicycling.
