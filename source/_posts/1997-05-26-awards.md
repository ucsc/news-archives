**Lisbeth Haas,** associate professor of history, has received the 1997 Elliott Rudwick Prize for her book _Conquests and Historical Identities in California, 1769-1936_ (University of California Press, 1995). The $2,000 prize is considered one of the most prestigious in the field. It is given biennially by the Organization of American Historians for an outstanding book on the experience of racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. Haas was presented with the award at the Presidential Banquet at the organization's annual meeting in San Francisco in mid-April.

**Susan Gillman,** professor of literature, received a $30,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for the project "American Race Melodramas, 1877 to 1915." Gillman's project aims to reinterpret the race literature by black and white writers of the late 19thh century by configuring them in the framework of the melodrama. In her abstract, Gillman notes that, "At the intersection of the literary and the scientific, high and popular literature, politics and aesthetics, the race melodrama represents a socially symbolic act generated by the highly conflicted historical circumstances of late nineteenth-century American race relations."
