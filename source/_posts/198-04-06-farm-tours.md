After a soggy winter, there's nothing like the sights and sounds of spring to inspire the gardener in all of us. Come feed your inspiration during a free docent-led tour of the 25-acre UCSC Farm, where spring is literally bursting out all over. The one-hour tours start Sunday, April 19, at 2 p.m.; they continue weekly through the fall on Thursdays at noon and Sundays at 2 p.m.

Blossoming orchards, freshly planted garden beds, and perennial borders buzzing with bees and birds are highlights of the tour. Visitors will also receive information about organic methods for growing fruit, vegetables, and flowers, as well as greenhouse techniques, compost-making, and the university's research in sustainable agriculture. The green-thumbed among us will appreciate learning about fruit, flower, and vegetable varieties that thrive in the Monterey Bay region.

Tours start at the Farm's entrance gate, located up the gravel path from the historic Blacksmith Shop near the base of campus. The Alan Chadwick Garden, located below Merrill College on the upper campus, is also open to visitors.

For more information on tours, or to arrange a special tour, call (408) 459-3248. For directions, call 459-4140. For more information about the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, which operates the UCSC Farm & Garden.
