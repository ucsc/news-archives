Faculty and staff, family, and community members gathered at UCSC recently to celebrate the investiture of art history professor Catherine Soussloff, who holds the Patricia and Rowland Rebele Endowed Chair in Art History. As chairholder, Soussloff will put in place a program titled "Visual Cultures on the California Border." The five-year program will involve students, distinguished scholars-in-residence, UCSC faculty, and curators from the Museum of Art and History.
