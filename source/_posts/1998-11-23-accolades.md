Professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics **Donald Osterbrock** has received the Hans Lippershey Award from the Antique Telescope Society in recognition of his contributions to the history of American astronomy.

As an astronomer, Osterbrock is known for his research on quasars, galactic structure, and interstellar matter. He served as director of the Lick Observatory from 1973 to 1981. He is the author of several books, including _Eye on the Sky: Lick Observatory's First Century_ (UC Press, 1988) and, most recently, _Yerkes Observatory, 1892-1950: The Birth, Near Death, and Resurrection of a Scientific Research Institution_ (University of Chicago Press, 1997).

Osterbrock's award citation reads, in part, "We in the Antique Telescope Society are now honoring [Osterbrock], not for his achievements in astronomy, important though they are, and not because he is an esteemed member of our society, but rather for his notable contributions to the history of American astronomy through his meticulous research and writings on the founding and subsequent history of a number of this country's most important observatories and the astronomers who used them."

Osterbrock is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and numerous professional organizations. Great Britain's Royal Astronomical Society awarded Osterbrock the 1997 Gold Medal, its highest honor. The American Astronomical Society and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific have both lauded Osterbrock's career with their lifetime achievement awards.

The Antique Telescope Society is an international organization that promotes interest in astronomical history and discovery, the history of optics, and the preservation and use of astronomical instruments.

The **Women's Soccer team,** coached by **Paul Lester,** had their best-ever season, finishing with a 12-5-1 record. They were particularly strong the second half of the season, winning their last six games in a row and nine of their last ten games. Graduating seniors on the team are midfielder Erin Cunniffe and forward Martha Gomez. This was Lester's third year coaching the Slug women and his second with the men's team. (photo: Dorth Raphaely)
