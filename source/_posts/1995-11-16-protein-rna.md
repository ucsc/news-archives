title: Scientists Map The Structure Of A Protein-Rna Complex In A Retrovirus

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Biochemists have published the first detailed  view of the molecular tango between two critical units in the life  cycle of a retrovirus--a virus that uses RNA, not DNA, to direct its  genetic infiltration of a host cell.

The research reveals a precise fit between the viral RNA and a  section of a protein that triggers the virus to make copies of itself.  The protein segment lies snugly within a curved groove in the RNA,  like a sausage resting in its bun. In an infected cell, this protein- RNA complex acts as a "switch" that turns on the assembly line for  further virus production.

The scientists derived this structure by studying the bovine  immunodeficiency virus, or BIV, which infects cows and is  genetically related to HIV. The work may set the stage for a better  grasp of a crucial step in the life cycle of HIV, which causes AIDS in  humans. However, the researchers caution, there are significant  differences in the ways that proteins bind to RNA in the two viruses,  so an immediate application to HIV research is unlikely.

Joseph Puglisi, an assistant professor of chemistry and  biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, led the study, which appears in the  November 17 issue of the journal Science. Coauthors are Lily Chen, a  former postdoctoral researcher at UC San Francisco, now at the  University of Vermont; Scott Blanchard, a technician in Puglisi's lab;  and Alan Frankel, associate professor of biochemistry and  biophysics at UC San Francisco.

"The interactions between RNA and protein are of paramount  importance to the life cycles of retroviruses," says Puglisi, a  member of the Center for the Molecular Biology of RNA at UCSC.  "This is only the fifth or sixth example of a detailed structure of a  protein-RNA complex, and it's the first time anyone has solved a  protein-RNA structure in a retrovirus."

The complex studied here is a popular one: Tat-TAR, the  subject of research in many labs investigating how retroviruses  reproduce. The retrovirus, be it BIV or HIV, co-opts the genetic  machinery of the host cell to make numerous proteins, including Tat,  and to copy strands of the virus's own genetic material, RNA. The  specific section of RNA to which the Tat protein sticks is called  TAR. Once the Tat-TAR tete-a-tete occurs, the cell spits out raw  material for new copies of the virus much more quickly.

In living cells, Tat is too large to study all at once. Thus, the  team focused on one small bit of the Tat protein. The researchers  used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  spectroscopy to find the structure of the Tat-TAR linkup. NMR probes  the relative positions of atoms held in a magnetic field by tickling  particular atoms with bursts of radio waves. A computer analyzes  the data to predict the most likely positions of atoms with respect  to each other. The final solution published in Science is the "best  fit" of twenty structures churned out by the computer as good  matches to the data. Before now, all other structures of protein-RNA  complexes came from crystallography studies, rather than from NMR.

"At the structural level of how the protein sees the RNA, this  is very much state-of-the-art," says Frankel. "It's a very important  step in understanding how the complex between RNA and protein  forms."

The final structure came as some surprise to the team.  Biologists know of many examples of proteins attaching to one of  the two grooves in DNA, which forms a double-stranded helix. RNA,  which is single-stranded, also can twist into a spiral shape.  However, the resulting grooves are much narrower--seemingly  inhospitable rest stops for a bulky protein. In the TAR section of the  viral RNA, a minor distortion widens the groove just enough to  accommodate the Tat protein, which folds neatly back on itself to  fit within the RNA's clutches.

"The irregularity opens up that narrow groove and basically  beckons the protein to come on in," says Puglisi. "Just a small  change in the structure lets the protein fit perfectly and make this  very intimate contact."

The paper in Science presents both an overall picture of how  the protein dovetails into the RNA groove and a detailed account of  which parts of the Tat protein interact with which bits of the TAR  RNA. The structure is consistent with studies from Frankel's lab at  UCSF, where researchers probed the Tat-TAR interaction with  biochemical, biophysical, and genetic methods.

Puglisi and Frankel hope to use the structure as a starting  point to designing a substance that could cripple this stage in the  proliferation of BIV. "These central steps in the life cycles of  retroviruses can be their Achilles' heels if we figure out how to  block the protein and RNA from interacting," Puglisi says. "Because  this structure is so simple, it doesn't take a genius to think up some  synthetic molecules that could do that."

But crossing over from BIV to HIV is not a simple proposition,  he notes. Most notably, the Tat-TAR system in HIV appears to involve  a third molecule, from the host cell, to form the final complex that  triggers the genetic machinery to make more RNA.
