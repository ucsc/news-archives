SANTA CRUZ, CA--A federal grant awarded to the University of  California system has made it possible for health educators from UC  Santa Cruz's Cowell Student Health Services to help plan a UC  systemwide alcohol and drug abuse prevention program.

The receipt of the grant this academic year marks the first  time the U.S. Department of Education's Fund for the Improvement of  Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) has awarded such a grant to a state  educational system. FIPSE funds about 40 organizations nationally  each year.

Acting as leader for the northern region, UC Santa Cruz has  received $43,000 of the $172,510 federal grant, plus an additional  $17,000 from the northern California UC campuses to pay for costs  associated with administering the planning process for the region.

"The grant provides the campuses with money to decide what  kinds of programs we should have at the university," said Anita Diaz,  director of Cowell Student Health Services at UCSC. "We expect this  planning will result in programs that are better coordinated and  serve the students better. We are fortunate on this campus to have  the strong support of both the chancellor and the vice chancellor for  Student Affairs."

Alcohol and drug abuse on college campuses, including the nine  UC campuses, should be reduced, said Jesus De La Rosa, alcohol and  other drug abuse prevention coordinator. Research shows that  college students use alcohol and drugs more than any other age group  and more than their peers not attending college.

UC staff and student health educators started meeting monthly  in September to discuss abuse prevention strategies at each campus.  In May, the group plans to meet with UC student affairs vice  chancellors from each campus to present a five-year agenda for  prevention programs and set a UC policy on drug and alcohol abuse.  With the grant, the health educators will then continue meeting and  refining the programs and policies until August 1996. \--more--

Through this process, health educators hope to give high-level  administrators an improved understanding of the programs required,  as well as impress them with the need for funding. The health  educators also say the process will result in a sharing of program  ideas.

The grant came at a good time for UCSC, said Diaz, because a  two-year Peer Education grant from FIPSE that provided funds for  many of the campus's alcohol and drug abuse prevention efforts  ended in December. "We will have to do some planning now around  what we need to do long term," she said.

UCSC's expired grant helped pay for a variety of drug and  alcohol abuse prevention programs, including on-campus social  events, such as dances, designed to teach students they could enjoy  themselves without drinking. It also supported a peer educator  program where students recovering from drug or alcohol abuse  talked to other students about their experience.

Although these programs were severely curtailed when the  funding expired, Diaz hopes to fully restart them, perhaps using  another grant or student registration fees. "We're trying to make  these programs a permanent part of our organization," she said.  "We're open to exploring any way that can happen."
