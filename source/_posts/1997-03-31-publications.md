**Gail Hershatter,** professor of history, is the author of _Dangerous Pleasures: Prostitution and Modernity in Twentieth-Century Shanghai_ (University of California Press, 1997). Hershatter makes use of a broad array of sources--from classical texts, to newspaper reports on court cases, to surveys by doctors and social workers--to present an intellectual history on one of society's most marginalized groups. She also uses debates on prostitution from within Chinese society as a means of examining Chinese perspectives on modernity.

Professor of music **Leta Miller** is the author of "C. P. E. Bach's Instrumental 'Recompositions': Revisions or Alternatives?" in the most recent volume of _Current Musicology_ (59:5-47). In the piece, Miller discusses Bach's seemingly obsessive compulsion to rework his old compositions. She examines what may have motivated this process and considers the results, e.g., is the revised work necessarily an improvement over the original piece and how do musicians deal with multiple versions of the same piece.
