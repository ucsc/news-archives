SANTA CRUZ, CA--Bell Hooks, whose writing addresses black  womanhood, feminism, the Civil Rights movement, and critical  theory, will be the keynote speaker for the eleventh annual Martin  Luther King, Jr., convocation taking place at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, on Thursday, January 12.

The convocation begins at 4 p.m. in the Porter College Dining  Hall. Admission is free, but tickets--available from the UCSC Ticket  Office--are required.

Open to the general public, the convocation honors the memory  of Dr. King with speakers, music, and a keynote address by a  prominent African American figure. Hooks's convocation speech is  titled "Building a Beloved Community: Ending Racism."

Born in 1955 as Gloria Watkins, Hooks writes under the name  of her great-great-grandmother to honor, according to Paula  Giddings in Ms. magazine, "the unlettered wisdom of her  foremothers." (Editor's note: Bell Hooks writes her name entirely in  lower-case letters.)

After growing up in Kentucky, Hooks earned a bachelor's degree  from Stanford University and a Ph.D. from UCSC. She went on to work  as an associate professor in the African American Studies  Department at Yale University, then as a professor at Oberlin College  in the Departments of English and Women's Studies. Currently, she is  a distinguished professor of literature at City College of New York.

Hooks has written numerous articles and books, including  Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom  (1994); Yearning: Race, Gender, and Cultural Politics (1990); and  Ain't I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism (1981).

A Publisher's Weekly poll in 1992 named Ain't I a Woman one of  the "twenty most influential women's books of the last twenty  years."

Another of Hooks's books, Breaking Bread: Insurgent Black  Intellectual Life (1991), explored black images in areas including  advertising, Madonna's music videos, and the Anita Hill- Clarence Thomas hearings. Written with social critic Cornel West,  the book caused a Library Journal critic to remark, "Hooks continues  to produce some of the most challenging, insightful, and provocative  writing on race and gender in the United States today."

Hooks is currently writing "A Killing Rage," a book about the  later works of Dr. King, which will be released in September 1995.

At the convocation on January 12, the Reverend Robert Renfro  of the Progressive Missionary Baptist Church in Santa Cruz will  offer an invocation. The church's youth choir and Rita Lackey, a  soloist and UCSC alumna, will perform. Assistant professor David  Anthony of Oakes College will emcee. A reception follows.

The event is presented by Arts & Lectures in collaboration  with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. Parking  is free in the Performing Arts parking lot. For more information, call  the UCSC Ticket Office, (408) 459-2159.
