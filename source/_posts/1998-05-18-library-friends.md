Poet and novelist Nathaniel Mackey will read from his works during the 32nd annual meeting of the Friends of the UCSC Library. The event takes place at 4 p.m. on Thursday, May 21, on the north patio of McHenry Library. An election of the new members of the Friends Board of Directors will take place prior to the poetry reading. A reception follows. The event is free and open to the public.

A professor of literature at UCSC, Mackey has authored nearly a dozen books and monographs and is the recipient of a 1993 Whiting Writers' Award. His interest in jazz and African culture informs his critically acclaimed work. His publications include _Whatsaid Serif_ (his third book of poems, due out in late spring); _Song of the Andoumboulou 18-20_ (1994); _School of Udhra _(1993); _Djbot Baghostus's Run_ (1993); _Bedouin Hornbook_ (1986); _Eroding Witness_ (1985); and _Discrepant Engagement: Dissonance, Cross-Culturality, and Experimental Writing_ (1993). His compact disc recording _Strick: Song of the Andoumboulou 16-25_ (1995) presents him reading his work accompanied by musicians Royal Hartigan and Hafez Modirzadeh.

Mackey edits the literary journal _Hambone_ and is coeditor of _Moment's Notice: Jazz in Poetry and Prose_ (1993). He teaches creative writing and African American, contemporary, and experimental literature.
