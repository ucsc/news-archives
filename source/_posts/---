Many common herbal remedies can be successfully grown, prepared, and used by the home gardener. There are also many herbs that commonly appear in local gardens. This class will focus on how to choose, grow, and use herbs from your garden.

Huckle, a graduate of the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, will cover plant identification, preparing and planting herb beds, and cultural requirements of common herbs.

The class will meet at Christopher Hobbs's Living Farmacy educational garden project in Bonny Doon. The fee is $25 for the general public; $20 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden. Preregistration is required; call John Fisher at (831) 459-3248 or send e-mail to [johnfish@cats.ucsc.edu][4].

The class is being offered by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems with support from the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden
