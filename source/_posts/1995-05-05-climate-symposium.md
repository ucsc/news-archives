SANTA CRUZ, CA--"Challenges for the Monterey Bay Region," a series  of conferences for researchers and interested citizens, gets under  way at UC Santa Cruz on Saturday, May 20, with a critical look at the  complex relationship between fisheries and climate change. The  symposium, entitled "Climate and Fisheries: Biological and Social  Issues," runs from 1 to 5 p.m. in Oakes College lecture hall 105 on  the UCSC campus. It is free and open to the public.

The symposium is cosponsored by the Monterey Bay Aquarium  and Monterey Bay Regional Studies (MBRS), a new program based at  UCSC. A major goal of MBRS is to draw together the region's  remarkable wealth of natural and social scientists to focus on  issues of common concern, and to inform the public of current  research and future directions.

Four speakers at the symposium will review the history of fish  management and policy in California and other regions,  environmental changes that are affecting nearshore ecosystems, and  the impacts of these changes on fish populations. Questions from the  audience will follow each talk.

Scheduled to speak are the following researchers:

* Alec MacCall, fisheries biologist and director of the Tiburon  Laboratories, National Marine Fisheries Service, Tiburon

* Arthur McEvoy, professor of law at the University of  Wisconsin Law School

* Richard Parrish, fisheries biologist with the Pacific  Fisheries Environmental Group, National Marine Fisheries Service,  Monterey

* Courtland Smith, professor of anthropology at Oregon State  University

"Fisheries have always formed an integral part of human  interactions with the Monterey Bay system," says Laurel Fox,  professor of biology at UCSC and director of MBRS. "We need look no  further than the bay's fisheries to observe the dramatic impacts  that we can have on the ocean. In order to form wise policies for the  future, we also must understand how climate variations can affect  these interactions."

Under the auspices of MBRS, teams of students and faculty are  crossing disciplinary lines to study the well-being of the Monterey  Bay environment. In addition to the public symposium, the program's  early stages at UCSC feature a new course and several research  "demonstration projects." Ultimately, MBRS planners envision a  baywide network of researchers working together on studies that  scientists from any one discipline would find daunting.
