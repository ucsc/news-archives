**Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group Gets First Look At Bird's Rapid Northward Quest For Salmon**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Along the wild rivers of Alaska and British Columbia,  immature bald eagles forage for dead salmon and learn to hunt for live ones  in the late summer and fall. The eagles fly north on fast migrations from  their birthplaces in California and elsewhere, stunning first journeys from  the nest honed by thousands of years of instinct.

At least, that's what wildlife biologists thought. Now, an information- age eagle has made that picture much more believable.

Scientists from the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group  (SCPBRG) at UC Santa Cruz have tracked, for the first time, a juvenile bald  eagle's remarkable coming-of-age quest for food and independence. The  eagle wears a tiny backpack fitted with a lightweight satellite transmitter  that beeps every 10 days. Signals from the satellite, sent via e-mail to  SCPBRG researchers, show that the bird flew some 900 miles in August  from its nest at Lake Shasta, in northern California, to the vicinity of the  Dean River in central British Columbia. The journey took less than three  weeks.

Subsequent signals reveal that the bird is staying at the Dean River,  apparently having found a rich source of food. Biologists think other young  eagles venture even further north, into northern British Columbia and  southeastern Alaska's spectacular fjords.

"Instinct drives these migrations," said SCPBRG researcher Grainger  Hunt, Ph.D. "These young birds have never hunted before and have never  caught anything. Yet they leave their parents behind and suddenly, they fly a  thousand miles north at the end of the summer. It's very surprising."

Hunt and SCPBRG wildlife biologist Ron Jackman tagged the eagle in  its nest at Lake Shasta after the bird had reached its full body size. Their  work, done in collaboration with Steve Zack of the Point Reyes Bird  Observatory, is part of a long-term study of bald eagles by the U.S. Forest  Service, Shasta Lake Ranger District.

Over the next two years, if both eagle and satellite tag survive, the  biologists will learn how long the bird remains in Canada and whether it  returns to its home range for breeding. The research also paves the way for  satellite tagging of more eagles, as well as falcons, seabirds, and other  species of interest.

Further, Hunt said, bald eagles offer a glimpse into cycles of nature  that, for the most part, remain hidden from view.

"Bald eagles are indicators of the health of the global ecosystem,"  Hunt said. "These telemetry studies will teach us about the eagles' food web.  We may learn that the ecology of California bald eagles is tied to the health  of the northern salmon runs, and thus to the abundance of plankton in the  Pacific Ocean."

Hunt speculates that juvenile bald eagles start by eating carrion along  the mouths and inland stretches of big rivers with huge salmon die-offs.  Later, they learn how to catch live fish--a necessity before they reach  breeding age.

The satellite technology is a leap forward from SCPBRG's previous  method of choice, radio telemetry. For instance, Hunt attempted to follow  several young bald eagles northward by plane in the mid-1980s, tracking  them on signals emitted by radio transmitters. He saw how quickly they  flew, crossing the Canadian border from Lake Shasta in less than a week.  Hunt managed to keep up with one bird as far north as Lake George, British  Columbia--inland and farther north than the Dean River. But in all cases,  poor weather forced him back before he learned the birds' destinations.

"This is a completely different kind of wildlife biology, like going  from a typewriter to a word processor," said Brian Walton, longtime SCPBRG  coordinator. "This technology will be important for tracking seabirds, which  we can't follow by plane." Such birds, Walton noted, could include birds  injured in oil spills, then cleaned and released. Satellite tags present a new  way to gauge the effectiveness of those techniques.

If the eagle's transmitter works properly, the researchers will get a  report on its location every 10 days for the next two years. The backpack's  straps are designed to fail after that time. Hunt and Walton hope to retrieve  the $3,000 transmitter after it falls off for possible future use.

SCPBRG researchers use Geographic Information Systems technology  to map the bird's movements. The project is part of the group's overall  management efforts for birds of prey, including the peregrine falcon in  California. SCPBRG is credited with restoring the peregrine falcon to  healthy breeding levels in the state throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
