**$4.4 Million Grant From The National Science Foundation Funds Five-Year Project**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--In one of the campus's most ambitious  partnerships with public schools, the University of California, Santa  Cruz, and the Life Lab Science Program are coordinating a five-year,  tri-county project designed to improve science education for K-6  bilingual students.

A $4.4 million grant from the National Science Foundation  (NSF) has funded the Language Acquisition in Science Education in  Rural Schools, or LASERS, project. More than 50 elementary schools  in seven school districts across central California will participate  in the project. Ultimately, more than 30,000 students from the  following districts will be involved: Alisal, Aromas-San Juan,  Hollister, King City, North Monterey, Pajaro, and Salinas. (See below  for list of schools involved in the first phase of the project this  year.)

The goal of LASERS is to develop a model of science education  that reaches students from diverse cultural and linguistic  backgrounds. The project will make links between school science and  the scientific ideas and language children have developed in their  homes, communities, and local ecology, says Trish Stoddart, an  associate professor of education at UCSC and the principal  investigator on the LASERS project. Co-principal investigators on  the project are Lucinda Pease-Alvarez, an assistant professor of  education at UCSC, and Roberta Jaffe, executive director of the Life  Lab Science Program, which is based at UCSC. The project will  include Life Lab's garden-based curriculum, which will be used to  introduce students to scientific concepts and to help make the  subject matter accessible and meaningful.

"These are students who live in three of the most productive  agricultural regions of the world," says Stoddart. "They've grown up  near fields of fruits and vegetables, and many are the children of  farmworkers, which makes Life Lab an especially appropriate  teaching tool because it builds on experiences in their daily lives.  And because the subject matter is familiar to parents, we hope they  will become more involved, too."

Language development in both the first and second languages  needs a meaningful context, which LASERS will provide, says Pease- Alvarez, who will coordinate the language development  aspects of the project.

Life Lab provides a ready platform for language development  because describing what is happening in the garden is an integral  part of the curriculum, says Jaffe. The Life Lab curriculum teaches  physical, earth, and life science in a "garden laboratory," and each  school's garden allows students to have a "hands-on" experience.  Moreover, as part of the computer technology component, students at  LASERS schools will go on-line with each other to compare garden  and weather information. Life Lab is currently being used by more  than 1,000 schools in 36 states. Jaffe will coordinate the  professional development effort for teachers.

LASERS is one of the first projects funded under NSF's Local  Systemic Initiative, which is designed to take a new approach to  school improvement by impacting the total institutional and  community systems that affect the teaching and learning process.  "This is a unique opportunity to bring together the expertise of  teachers, administrators, parents, business and community  members, Life Lab staff developers, and university researchers to  develop a model of bilingual science education for the region and the  nation," says Ylda Nogueda, assistant superintendent of elementary  education in the Pajaro Valley Unified School District.

The LASERS project received the endorsement of UCSC  Chancellor Karl S. Pister, who said it reflects the spirit of UCSC  partnerships in the community. "By reaching out to schools and  targeting an underserved student population, this project represents  an important part of what UCSC has to offer," said Pister. "Teachers  will benefit, students will benefit, and university researchers will  benefit."

To maximize the reach of the program, two lead teachers from  each school will attend four seminars and an annual two-week  summer professional development institute at UCSC. Those teachers  and one parent coordinator from each school will then help  implement LASERS at their schools, including training teachers and  staff. In addition, each school is forming a steering committee made  up of the lead teachers, a site administrator, and community  representatives.

Teachers will be encouraged to improve their own science  backgrounds and to develop more confidence in their science  teaching skills, says Stoddart. They will also learn the latest  techniques of teaching science to bilingual students and strategies  to adapt the curriculum to the migrant lifestyle shared by many  students in rural areas.

"NSF is predicting that there will be a shortage of 750,000  scientists and engineers by the year 2006," says Stoddart. "It's  critical that we keep these children in the pipeline and prepare them  for higher education. A big part of that is improving their language  skills and learning to make science and technology interesting and  accessible to them."

The NSF grant concentrates on staff development to ensure  that the program will continue beyond the life of the five-year  grant, says Stoddart. Project participants are actively seeking  financial and material support from business and community groups.
