**Making the News highlights campus people interviewed or covered by news media.**

Composer **David Cope's** work on EMI, a computer program he invented, has seen a flurry of attention in the media of late. Leading off the crowd was _New Scientist_ magazine, which made EMI its cover story for August 9\. Other print media that covered the story recently include the _New York Times_ (upcoming), _London Daily Telegraph, London Times, Guardian, Welt am Sonntag_ (Germany), _Neue Kronen Zeitung_ (Austria), _Johannesburg Times_ (South Africa), _Australian, Scotsman, Rocky Mountain News, San Francisco Chronicle, Bangor Daily News, Lingua Franca, San Francisco Chronicle,_ and the _Santa Barbara News Press._ Radio coverage included the Canadian Broadcasting Company, Sweden's Sveriges Radio, Denmark's Danish Broadcasting Corp., the BBC, the Australian Broadcasting Company and, in other media, "Brainstorms" on Omni Internet and an extended interview on BBC's _Hardtalk_ TV program.

The _San Francisco Chronicle_ called upon astrophysicist **Lars Hernquist** for comment upon spectacular Hubble Space Telescope photos of two colliding galaxies. The topic was right up Hernquist's alley, as he has conducted supercomputer simulations of galactic smashups for years.

**Guillermo Delgado** of Latin American and Latino studies was cited recently in the letters column of _Ms._ magazine. A reader questioned a reference in a story to a law of ancient indigenous Peruvians, and _Ms._ turned to Delgado for clarification.
