SANTA CRUZ, CA--The W. M. Keck Foundation of Los Angeles has  awarded $450,000 to the University of California, Santa Cruz, for  equipment that will let chemists and biologists explore the  structures and functions of molecules that play roles in causing or  treating human diseases.

The grant will help establish a laboratory for the study of  biomolecules--substances that take part in the everyday processes  of human life within our cells. A broad spectrum of UCSC scientists  will use the new tools to study topics such as potential drugs from  the tissues of marine organisms, proteins that can trigger cancer or  other diseases by folding into certain harmful shapes, and enzymes  that fix damaged DNA.

Such studies are many years removed from a new cure or  treatment. However, all diseases arise from countless biomolecules  gone awry: genes that have mutated, proteins that have stopped  working, viruses that have commandeered a cell's machinery.  Discovering the structures of such molecules, how they interact in  the cell, and how they arise in the first place forms the basis for  understanding a disease and finding ways to stop it.

Most of the funds from the Keck Foundation will pay for a new  mass spectrometer, a sophisticated instrument that analyzes the  compositions of substances in fine detail and provides clues about  their molecular structures. The remaining funds will upgrade an  existing facility for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,  purchased last year with grants from the Elsa U. Pardee Foundation  ($100,000) and the National Science Foundation.

"This state-of-the-art equipment will significantly enhance  the research capabilities of our faculty," says Thomas Schleich,  chairman of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.  "Declining budgets have made it very difficult for us to meet these  needs without private support from donors such as the Keck  Foundation."

The W. M. Keck Foundation has a long history of supporting  scientific research at UCSC. Its total donations to the campus now  exceed $1.35 million, including awards of $250,000 and $600,000 to  UCSC's Institute of Tectonics in 1986 and 1990, respectively, for  equipment related to research on earthquakes and the physics of the  earth.

About twenty faculty members in the Department of Chemistry  and Biochemistry and the Department of Biology will use the new  equipment to advance the frontiers of their fields. Planned research  includes the following:

* Studies of compounds from marine sponges and other sea  life, by a group led by professor of chemistry Phillip Crews. Many  such compounds, which may have evolved in the organisms as self-defense chemicals, hold promise for treating cancer and other  diseases. Accurate information about the structures of these  compounds is vital. In addition, the new equipment will let Crews  use minuscule amounts of the compounds in each analysis, thus  conserving his precious supply.
* Research on the structures of proteins, in the labs of  associate professor of chemistry Glenn Millhauser and assistant  professor of biology Lydia Gregoret. Proteins are long strings of  building blocks, called amino acids, that fold into complex 3-D  shapes. The shape of each protein determines its precise role in the  cell. Millhauser and Gregoret are studying the structures of protein  fragments that may contribute to Alzheimer's disease and certain  cancers.
* Studies of the interactions between DNA and proteins, by  assistant professor of chemistry Sheila David and her team. David,  who holds a Young Investigator Award from the Arnold and Mabel  Beckman Foundation, explores an enzyme that repairs a specific type  of damage in DNA, the genetic instructions in our cells. When such  enzymes don't work, the damaged DNA directs the cell to churn out  dysfunctional molecules. Diseases such as hereditary colon cancer  can result.

"The new mass spectrometer and the upgraded NMR facility  will serve a diverse group of chemists and biologists, giving us  structural information that is essential to rapid research progress,"  says research professor of chemistry David Deamer, whose work  could contribute to the successful mapping of the genes carried by  every person. "That basic information is the foundation for all other  studies, for it essentially tells us about the processes of life at the  molecular level."

One of the nation's largest foundations in terms of annual  grants, the W. M. Keck Foundation was established in 1954 by the  late William M. Keck, founder of The Superior Oil Company, who also  created in his will the W. M. Keck Trust for the sole benefit of the  foundation. The primary focus of the foundation is on grants to  universities and colleges throughout the U.S., with particular  emphasis in the fields of science, engineering, and medical research.  It also provides limited support, focused on programs serving  southern California, in the areas of community services, health care,  precollegiate education, and the arts.
