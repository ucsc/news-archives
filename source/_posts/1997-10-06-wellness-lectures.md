title: Wellness Award Lectures 
author: Irene Bronston
---

Please join us in October for the seventh year of Wellness Award Lectures on various campuses.

The faculty awardees were selected competitively in response to an annual call for abstracts, issued in the spring. A distinguished universitywide steering committee selects six awardees on the basis of a blind peer review of abstracts. The awardees prepare a paper and present a lecture drawn from the paper on their respective campuses each fall. The Wellness Lectures Program provides an award of $3,000 to each awardee, in addition to $1,000 for research assistance.

The Wellness Lectures are funded by a grant from The California Wellness Foundation (TCWF). Created in 1992 as a private and independent foundation, TCWF's mission is to improve the health of the people of California through proactive support of health promotion and disease-prevention programs.

Each lecture will be hosted by the chancellor or provost and is free and open to the campus community and public. The lectures are followed by a reception.

Early in 1998, a bound collection of all the lectures will be mailed to policymakers, legislators, and health professionals. Videotapes and audiotapes of the lecture can also be purchased in 1998. The collection of bound lectures is free and available upon request.

Please feel free to share this information with your colleagues via e-mail.
