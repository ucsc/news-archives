SANTA CRUZ, CA--Marine researchers at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, have received $100,000 from a $2.2 million  settlement between Shell Oil Company and the California Public  Interest Research Group (CalPIRG). Six research teams will use the  funds to launch or enhance various studies on  he water quality of the San Francisco Bay.

The settlement, announced in February, resulted from one of  the largest citizen Clean Water Act lawsuits in state history. Shell  Oil agreed to reduce drastically its discharges of the toxic  substance selenium into the bay from its refinery in Martinez. The  company also paid $2.2 million to various agencies in the region for  environmental research, restoration, and education  projects relating to the bay and its threatened ecosystem.

Selenium is present in crude oil and is released as waste from  oil refineries. As a result of selenium discharges to San Francisco  Bay, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has designated  parts of the bay as "toxic hot spots" under the Clean Water Act. The  state government has issued health warnings against eating certain  ducks from the bay.

CalPIRG's lawsuit forced Shell to agree to reduce its  discharges of selenium at a faster rate than was required by the San  Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board. The settlement  calls for Shell to cut gradually its discharges from 5.8 pounds per  day in early 1995 to 2.13 pounds per day by July 1998. CalPIRG also  demanded the elimination of all loopholes that would have allowed  Shell to challenge that final limit.

"This settlement shows that citizens have the power to force  huge corporations like Shell to reduce their pollution, and shows  that citizens are willing to go to the mat to protect the natural  resources they love," says Mary Raftery, program director at  CalPIRG. "This lawsuit sends the message to Shell and other oil  companies that it doesn't pay to pollute."

University of California researchers received $250,000 from  the settlement, of which $100,000 went to the Institute of Marine  Sciences at UC Santa Cruz. After an internal review of proposals, the  following six projects earned portions of the Shell funds:

* $20,000 for studies of trace metals in the bay, including  which chemical species may be toxic to plant life, and development  of a technique to measure many trace metals at once. Team leader:  Kenneth Bruland, professor of marine sciences.
* $20,000 for upgrading a mass spectrometer to lower the  detection limits for elements such as lead, copper, zinc, cadmium,  and cobalt in the waters and sediments of the bay. Team leader:  Russell Flegal, professor of earth sciences.
* $20,000 for studies of the interaction between  contaminants in the bay and natural colloids, suspended particles  that can affect the toxicity of a substance. Team leader: Mark Wells,  assistant research marine chemist.
* $15,000 to measure the levels of various organochlorine  compounds, such as PCBs and other industrial pollutants, in the bay's  waters. Team leader: Walter Jarman, postdoctoral researcher.
* $13,000 for studies of the cycles of carbon and nitrogen  among the bay's water, sediments, and bottom-dwelling organisms.  Team leader: Jane Caffrey, assistant research oceanographer.
* $12,000 for an analysis of the role of a non-native species,  the Asian clam, in the food web of the northern bay. Team leader:  Mary Silver, professor of marine sciences.

CalPIRG is a statewide environmental and consumer protection  advocacy organization with over 70,000 members. It was  represented in this lawsuit by attorneys from the Boston-based  National Environmental Law Center and the San Francisco firm of  Sideman & Bancroft.
