Many of those who established subject endowments attended the December event at McHenry Library. Pictured in front of the wall bearing their names are: (Back row,  l-r) Merryl Cicourel, Michael Clark, Marion Taylor, Charles and Jean Engel, Ton and Thelma Jue, Rolf Augustine, committee chair Lynn Stegner, and University Librarian Allan Dyson. (Front row, l-r): Rita Bottoms, Miriam Patchen, Florence Wykcoff, Emily Clark, Janet Reed, and Pat Beresford. Not pictured, but also in attendance, were Anne and Paul Levin and Mickey Rebecchi of the Long Foundation.

A mid-December ceremony honored several dozen donors who have made contributions to the University Library's subject endowment collection, which now has an overall value of nearly $1 million.

Twenty-three endowments have been established by donors in a range of subjects from horticulture to Jewish studies to the Pacific Rim. The endowments are an important means of expanding the library collection, providing a source of ongoing support for acquisitions in a specific area of interest.

"The library is here, not just for today's faculty and students, but for the scholars of tomorrow," said University Librarian Allan Dyson. "Through the establishment of endowed funds, our farsighted supporters have ensured that the record of human knowledge will be documented, preserved, and made accessible as far as we can see into the future."

The names of the library's philanthropists and the 23 endowments they have established are commemorated on plaques in the entryway to McHenry Library on a "wall of honor." The wall was unveiled at the December ceremony attended by donors, their families, and friends of the library.

Noted writer and UCSC alumna Lynn Stegner, chair of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation's Library Development Committee, commented on the myriad values of the subject endowment in broadening and enhancing the library's collection. "A book is not just a way of containing information. A book is the thing itself--it has weight and scent and it engages the imagination and the memory. For those reasons it is intrinsically human. If we can't save that part of ourselves as a species then we're in deep trouble."

The names of the endowments are listed below. For more information on establishing an endowment, contact Library Development Officer Margaret Gordon at (408) 459-4211.
