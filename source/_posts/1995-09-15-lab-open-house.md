SANTA CRUZ, CA--The sixteenth annual open house at the Long  Marine Laboratory, set for Sunday, October 15, has something for  everyone: adults who wish to learn more about Monterey Bay,  students considering marine science as a career, and kids of all ages  who want to see research up close or just pick up a prickly or slimy  sea critter.

Between 2,000 and 4,000 people attend the open house each  year at the lab, perched atop a coastal bluff at the western edge of  Santa Cruz. Admission is free to the open house, which runs from 10  a.m. to 4 p.m. Parking is available at Silicon Systems, 2300  Delaware Avenue. Shuttle buses will transport people to the lab.

Long Marine Lab is a marine-research facility operated by UC  Santa Cruz. Since it opened in 1978, the lab has devoted its  resources to understanding the bay's unique environment and to  addressing other worldwide issues in the marine sciences.

Highlights of this year's open house include the following:

* Live demonstrations of research projects with sea lions.
* Viewing of Primo and Puka, two U.S. Navy dolphins on loan to  the lab, from an overlook.
* Talks, videos, and slide shows by researchers at UCSC's  Institute of Marine Sciences.
* Open research labs with microscopes, marine invertebrates,  and other creatures.
* A "children's corner," touch tanks, and many other marine- oriented activities for kids.
* A dance performance, "Sanctuary," by children from the  Montessori School of Santa Cruz.
* Live jazz music by Crosswinds.
* A variety of foods from local vendors, such as chowder,  burritos, tamales, pizza, salads, and bottled juices.

The event is accessible to those with disabilities; people  needing special arrangements should call the lab in advance.
