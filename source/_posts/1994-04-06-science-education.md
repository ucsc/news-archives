SANTA CRUZ, CA--For fifteen years, Shirley Malcom has striven to  find ways to increase public support for science education and to  encourage students, especially young women and minorities, to  pursue careers in science. She will share her thoughts on these  ongoing challenges in a free public lecture at UC Santa Cruz at 4 p.m.  Tuesday, April 19, in the Stevenson College Fireside Lounge. Her talk is entitled "Human Resources for Science: Who, What, When,  Where, How?"

The lecture is the second in the Chancellor's Distinguished  Seminar Series on Mission, Quality, and Diversity, established in the  fall by Chancellor Karl S. Pister and the Academic Senate, UCSC's  faculty body. Pister created the seminar series to encourage campus  dialogue on themes that he views as critical to UCSC's success. The  series is the public part of a program in which prominent women and  minorities spend a day with faculty and students at UCSC to discuss  how to improve the quality of higher education in the United States.

Malcom headed the Office of Opportunities in Science at the  American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) from  1979 to 1989. Since then, she has led the AAAS Directorate for  Education and Human Resources Programs. She oversees AAAS  programs in education, activities for underrepresented groups, and  public understanding of science and technology. Malcom has been  recognized for her efforts to improve the education of young women  and minorities by involving community organizations and parents in  education reform.

Malcom served on the Clinton-Gore transition team, chairing a  task group on vocational and technical education for the  Departments of Education and Labor. Before joining the government,  she was an assistant professor of biology at the University of North  Carolina at Wilmington.
