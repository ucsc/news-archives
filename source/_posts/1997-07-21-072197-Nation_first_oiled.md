## Nation's First Oiled Wildlife Center Opens Next To Long Marine Lab

SANTA CRUZ, CA--California's citizens, be they environmentalists or  petroleum industrialists, are united in their hopes that the state  will never suffer a catastrophic oil spill along its coastline. But if  the unthinkable occurs, rescue workers are now much better  prepared to deal with the resulting onslaught of tarred sea otters,  seabirds, and other wildlife.

That preparedness stems from the state's new Oiled Wildlife  Veterinary Care and Research Center, which state and local officials  will dedicate today (July 21) in a ceremony on UCSC property next to  the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory. The $5 million facility, the  first of its kind in the nation, opens after four years of planning and  more than a year of construction at the oceanfront site.

Researchers from the California Department of Fish and Game's  Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response (OSPR) and UCSC's  Institute of Marine Sciences will operate the center jointly as a  full-time research facility. Veterinarians, toxicologists, and other  scientists will collaborate on studies related to the impact of  petroleum products on California's wildlife and habitat, as well as  baseline studies of the health of marine mammals and seabirds.

In the event of an oil spill, the center can accommodate 125  sea otters, 100 marine birds, and a few seals and sea lions, cleaned  and cared for by up to 100 veterinary staff, researchers, and  volunteers. The center also will host periodic training and response  exercises for OSPR teams.

Speakers at the dedication ceremony will include OSPR  Administrator Pete Bontadelli, UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood,  and California Department of General Services Deputy Director  Eugene A. Spindler II. Guests will include U.S. Representative Sam  Farr, who as a California assemblyman spearheaded the center's  creation and the selection of Long Marine Lab as its site.

"We never know when an oil spill is going to happen or how  widespread the damage will be," Farr said. "The rescue center will  ensure that animals will be treated quickly and professionally."

The state legislature mandated the center in 1991 in response  to concerns that a large spill could endanger or wipe out numerous  species, especially the threatened California sea otter. Funding came  from a tax imposed upon oil companies and from lease sales of  offshore drilling sites in southern California.

The chaotic nature of the animal rescue effort in Alaska  following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 convinced many  researchers that a permanent facility would improve the chances of  saving wildlife. The new center focuses on sea otters, whose thick  fur and nearshore living patterns make them particularly vulnerable  to oil's damaging effects.

Six full-time and two part-time veterinary, research, and  administrative staff members from the Department of Fish and Game  will work at the center. UCSC researchers will have continual  access to two outdoor marine-mammal pools and some of the indoor  lab space. During non-emergency times, two other outdoor pools and  additional lab space also will be reserved for UCSC and Long Marine  Lab use.

Specific areas of collaboration planned by UCSC groups include:

\-- Research on sea otters via field-based studies of their  population dynamics, ecology, and habitat. Long Marine Lab lies near  the northern end of the 220-mile range of the California sea otter.  Several UCSC and OSPR researchers have worked with sea otters,  both in California and in Alaska after the Exxon Valdez spill.

\-- Studies of the basic physiology and energetics of captive  otters and other coastal animals rescued as orphans or from  strandings. Researchers from Long Marine Lab, a member of the  California Marine Mammal Stranding Network, respond to strandings  from Ano Nuevo south to the central Monterey Bay.

\-- Toxicological studies on the effects of oil on animals  injured during spills. Such research would complement an active  UCSC-directed program at the Department of Fish and Game's Granite  Canyon station, south of Carmel, on the toxic actions in marine  organisms of various types of oil, as well as the effectiveness and  toxic actions of dispersants and cleaning agents used to treat oil  spills.
