**Lindsay Hinck:** Assistant Professor of Biology

Lindsay Hinck studies the growth and development of the embryonic nervous system, focusing on the signaling molecules that guide the growth of neurons toward their targets. Her research takes advantage of the close similarities between the signaling molecules found in vertebrates and those in the nematode worm _Caenorhabditis elegans._ Ultimately she aims to understand how this signaling system guides the development of neural connections in the brain. Hinck received her B.S. degree in biology from Western Washington University, her M.S. in biochemistry from UC Davis, and her Ph.D. in cancer biology from Stanford University. Before joining the UCSC faculty, she was a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Francisco.
