title: UCSC Enters A Busy Summer Conference Season
author: UCSC Currents

UCSC will host nearly 60 camps, conferences, institutes, and meetings this summer, on subjects ranging from Karposi's Sarcoma to virtual reality.

More than 10,000 visitors are expected to come to the campus for the 10-week conference season, which lasts from June 28 to September 5 this year.

The conference program generates roughly $3 million each year for UCSC. Conference guests purchase food and services from the campus and occupy the 2,400 beds at UCSC's eight residential colleges. Last year, the income generated from the summer season helped to offset room-and-board rates charged to each UCSC student this year by about $200. Other income was returned to UCSC's colleges to help support their programs for students. In addition, nearly 40 students will work for the conference program this summer.

Approximately 60 percent of summer bookings come from UCSC Extension, Summer Session, and academic programs sponsored by faculty and staff. Sports teams, businesses, youth groups, and government and professional organizations make up the remaining 40 percent of bookings.

Some of this year's conferences include:
* **Upward Bound** (June 23-August 5). Students from the U.S. and Pacific Islands focus on math and science in this six-week summer academy.
