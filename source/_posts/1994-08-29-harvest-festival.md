SANTA CRUZ, CA--Come celebrate the changing seasons at the first- ever Harvest Festival at the 25-acre Farm at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, on Saturday, September 24, from 1 p.m. to 5  p.m.

The festivities will include an apple tasting, a pie crust- making demonstration, talks on gardening topics, Farm tours, and  activities for children. Entertainment will be provided by Mariposa,  a popular acoustic folk music quartet that plays a collection of  traditional, contemporary, and original songs. Organic produce grown  on the Farm, including the highlights of this summer's bounty--dry- farmed tomatoes, sweet corn, apples, and beautiful flower  bouquets--will be available for purchase.

Fresh-squeezed organic apple juice will be yours for the  tasting, and more than twenty prizes donated by local merchants  will be given away during a raffle that will help fund a scholarship  in UCSC's Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture. Prizes include  $50 gift certificates from Gabriella Cafe, Echo, and the Herb Room;  three compact discs from Cymbaline Records; T-shirts from Cat N'  Canary and Pacific Wave; and two haircuts at Brats salon.

Raffle tickets, which cost $2 each or six for $10, will be  available at the festival, as well as at the produce cart at the base  of campus on Tuesdays and Fridays from noon to 6 p.m. The  apprenticeship is a six-month training course in organic farming and  gardening that is sponsored by UCSC's Center for Agroecology and  Sustainable Food Systems.

Admission to the festival is $2; admission is free for children  under twelve and members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm and  Garden, which is sponsoring the event. For more information, call  (408) 459-4140.
