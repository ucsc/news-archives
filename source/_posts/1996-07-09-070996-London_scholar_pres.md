author: [Barbara McKenna, Linda Hooper]

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Charles Dickens is the writer most closely  associated with Christmas. In fact, many consider him responsible  for defining the modern form of the holiday in England and the U.S. In  a talk titled "Dickens and Christmas," London scholar David Parker  will explain why. The talk takes place on Monday, July 29, at 7 p.m.  in Kresge Town Hall at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The  talk free and open to the public.

Parker, curator of London's Dickens House Museum, will  discuss how the modern concept of "Christmas spirit"--charity for  the poor, renewal of one's spirit, celebrations with family--were  popularized by Dickens's Christmas books, among them A Christmas  Carol.

His talk is presented as part of the annual Dickens Universe, a  weeklong conference taking place July 28 to August 3 at UCSC. The  conference brings together Dickens aficionados--both professional  and amateur--to look closely at a work by Dickens. Along with  lectures by world-renowned scholars, the Universe presents  performances, film screenings, Victorian teas, sherry hours, and a  book fair. The conference is open to the public.
