SANTA CRUZ, CA--Gastronomes, lovers of marine science, and  especially people who fit both categories won't want to miss  "Cheers at the Crow's Nest," a holiday celebration to benefit public  education programs at Long Marine Laboratory. This year's  festivities are scheduled for Thursday, December 5, at the Crow's  Nest Restaurant, 2218 East Cliff Drive, Santa Cruz.

For all diners who state their support for Long Marine Lab, the  Crow's Nest will donate one-third of the dinner proceeds between  5:30 and 8:30 p.m. to the Friends of Long Marine Lab. The friends  group also will receive one-third of all bar proceeds from 7:30 to  11:30 p.m. Patrons will enjoy eclectic and contemporary jazz music  by Chi Mizu throughout the evening.

Six guest bartenders will assist the Crow's Nest staff: Steve  Davenport, assistant director of the UC Santa Cruz Institute of  Marine Sciences (IMS), which operates Long Marine Lab; IMS research  specialist Rob Franks; Long Marine Lab dolphin trainer Billy Hurley;  Long Marine Lab docent Ruth Elder; Harriet Deck, owner of Schooner  Realty and president of the Friends of Long Marine Lab; and Nathan  Cross, principal of Shoreline Middle School and member of the  Friends of Long Marine Lab Board of Directors.
