The top two teams battled neck and neck down the final stretch of the Northern California Regional Ocean Sciences Bowl, but in the end the students from Mission San Jose High School in Fremont triumphed over Watsonville High School in the regional competition and will travel to Washington, D.C., in April to compete in the finals of the second annual National Ocean Sciences Bowl.

UCSC hosted the regional event for the second time this year. The fast-paced academic competition, modeled after the game-show Jeopardy and covering the full range of ocean-related sciences, involved 16 teams from 13 high schools throughout Northern and Central California.
