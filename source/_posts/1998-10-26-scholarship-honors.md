Eight UCSC graduate students were among the scholarship recipients recognized at the annual luncheon of the Northern California chapter of the Achievement

Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation. Chancellor Greenwood was the distinguished speaker at this year's ARCS luncheon, held October 13 in San Francisco.

The ARCS Foundation is dedicated to helping meet the nation's need for scientists and engineers by providing scholarships for outstanding students in the scientific and technological fields.

"ARCS is a phenomenal organization that touches the lives of numerous scholars and has a very real effect on our national interest," Greenwood said.

The ARCS Foundation is the most generous provider of annual awards to UCSC students. Since 1977, the ARCS Foundation has awarded UCSC students $600,000 in scholarships. This year, UCSC was awarded $60,000 and received an additional matching grant of $20,000 from an anonymous donor, for a total of 8 scholarships worth $10,000 each.

The following UCSC students received ARCS scholarships this year:
* Oliver Samuel Baker, Science Communication (1998 Mrs. Newton A. Cope ARCS Scholar)
* Krista Conger, Science Communication
* Liese Greenfelder, Science Communication
* Jennifer Johnson, Astronomy and Astrophysics
* Heather Logan, Physics
* Brigette Martini, Earth Sciences
* Randa Pfeifer Roland, Chemistry and Biochemistry
* Mark Schrope, Science Communication

The scholarships are open to any graduate or undergraduate student in the Natural Sciences Division or the Jack Baskin School of Engineering.
