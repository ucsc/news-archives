## Market Cart Opens June 15 At UC Santa Cruz

SANTA CRUZ, CA--If the chilly spring has left you hungrier than ever for fresh organic produce, mark your calendar for Tuesday, June 15, because that's the day the popular market cart at UC Santa Cruz opens.

Enjoy the bounty of the UCSC Farm & Garden by stopping by the market cart, which is located at the main entrance of campus. The cart features picked-that-morning fruit, vegetables, and flowers. It will be open every Tuesday and Friday afternoon from noon until 6 p.m. in front of the Barn Theater at the intersection of Bay and High Streets.

As always, the cart will offer $5 bouquets, featuring sweet peas, sunflowers, larkspur, alstroemeria, foxglove, coreopsis, feverfew, and more. The array of fresh organic fruits and vegetables grows as the season progresses, but early offerings include gourmet salad mix, tender lettuces, several varieties of potatoes, and sweet carrots. As summer unfolds, watch for sweet corn, flavorful dry-farmed tomatoes, an array of sweet and hot peppers, apples, plums, basil and other herbs, and more.

The cart will be open through the summer and into the fall, depending on the length of the growing season. All proceeds benefit the UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems' apprenticeship program in ecological horticulture. For more information, call (831) 459-3248.
