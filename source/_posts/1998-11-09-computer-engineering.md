A unique and timely UCSC master's degree program has entered its second year.

The degree program--a master's of science in computer engineering, with a specialization in network engineering--was specifically designed to serve Silicon Valley. It meets the demands of Silicon Valley companies for highly trained engineers and technical professionals to enter and practice in the specialized field of network engineering.

"We are very pleased at the success of this program, and our ability to serve a very real need in Silicon Valley," says Professor Patrick Mantey, dean of UCSC's School of Engineering.

Nearly 30 students were accepted into the master's degree program this year. These students come from leading high-tech companies in Silicon Valley, including: Adaptec, Adobe Systems, Bay Networks, Cisco Systems, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space, National Semiconductor, Pacific Bell, and Tandem Computers.

All courses in the program are project based, giving students the opportunity to apply what they learn to areas in network engineering, including: network management, network security, network performance, multimedia transport, and high-speed networks.

Most of the courses use the latest in videoconferencing technology, with full video and audio connections between UCSC's main campus and its remote site--the UCSC Extension high-tech classroom facility in Cupertino.

"This technology enables Silicon Valley-based engineers to fully participate in intercampus courses, using the latest in videoconferencing capabilities," says Tim Johnson, associate dean of UCSC Extension.
