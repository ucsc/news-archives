SANTA CRUZ, CA--When a magazine collector in Japan described the  allure of America to young Japanese, he told film director Chip Lord  that this country has an "aroma of enchantment." Lord knew he had  just heard the title for his documentary-in-progress. In a talk titled  "The Aroma of Enchantment and Other Works," Lord will show  excerpts from and discuss his film on the image of America in Japan.

The talk, which is free and open to the public, takes place  Tuesday, May 16, at 8 p.m. in the Performing Arts Concert Hall, at  the University of California, Santa Cruz. Lord's talk is being  presented as part of both UCSC's Inaugural Lecture series and the  Pacific Rim Film Festival.

Lord is a professor of theater arts at UCSC where he teaches  courses in film and video. He filmed The Aroma of Enchantment  during a 1991 fellowship in Tokyo with the U.S.-Japan Friendship  Commission. Lord says that during the filming he discovered that,  "The idea that many Japanese have about America derives from the  post-World War II years and from media images at the time, such as  ads depicting big cars and suburban homes. That Norman Rockwell  idea of America has remained alive in the Japanese imagination."

In the film, Lord connects interviews with people like the  magazine collector and a female jazz singer to his own experiences  as a foreigner in Japan. Since its completion in 1992, The Aroma of  Enchantment has been shown in a number of festivals around the  world, including the Hawaii International Film Festival, the Image  Forum Festival in Japan, and the Dallas Video Festival.

Lord will also show other works including Cadillac Ranch  (1974/1994), a roadside sculpture in Amarillo, Texas, consisting of  ten buried Cadillacs. The sculpture was installed by Lord and former  partners in the group Ant Farm.

Inaugural Lectures are presented to celebrate a UCSC faculty  member's promotion or appointment to the position of full professor.  The lectures are presented by UCSC Arts & Lectures and supported by  the Offices of the Chancellor and Executive Vice Chancellor, the  Council of Provosts, and University Affiliates.
