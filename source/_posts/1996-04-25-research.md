author: [Amy Adams, Robert Irion]

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Have you ever wondered about the taxonomy of  Barney? If cats react differently to bearded men? Whether you can  actually compare apples and oranges? These and other unlikely  research topics have found their way into The Annals of Improbable  Research, the sponsor of Harvard University's yearly Ig Nobel prizes.

Marc Abrahams, editor of The Annals of Improbable Research,  will speak at UC Santa Cruz on Thursday, May 2. His seminar and  slide show, titled "Advances in Improbable Research," begins at 7:30 p.m. in room 150, Stevenson College. Admission is free.

The talk will include highlights from last year's Ig Nobel  ceremonies, which celebrated research that "cannot or should not be  reproduced." Winning topics included an analysis of soggy breakfast  cereal, teaching pigeons to distinguish between the works of Monet  and Picasso, the impact of wet underwear on the health of Danish  citizens, and a patient preference study on waxed versus unwaxed  dental floss. Abrahams encourages heckling, lab coats, and other  appropriate or inappropriate regalia.

The Science Communication Program at UCSC is sponsoring the  lecture by Abrahams. For more information, call the program at  (408) 459-4475.
