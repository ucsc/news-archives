SANTA CRUZ, CA--November in Antarctica: sunshine round the clock,  melting ice, calm weather. Perfect conditions for an explosion of  plant growth in the water, fueling a future feeding frenzy for  penguins, walruses, whales, and seabirds. A perfect time, too, for a  cruise to study the workings of this food web--the foundation of one  of the planet's most lush ecosystems.

For UC Santa Cruz scientists David Garrison and Marcia  Gowing, the November 1994 cruise was no QE2 vacation. Rather, they  and about 30 other researchers put in long days to gather as much  information as possible on the microscopic aquatic life that teems  off the white continent each spring. The voyage took place in an ice- free zone within the highly productive Ross Sea, some 2,000 miles  south of New Zealand. It offered researchers their earliest glimpse  yet into Antarctica's short but intense growing season.

Careful analysis of the hundreds of water samples and millions  of organisms preserved by Garrison and Gowing may yield clues to  some intriguing mysteries: Which types of algae are most critical to  the food web? Could the ozone "hole" over Antarctica affect their  life cycles and disturb the entire ecosystem? How much carbon do  the organisms remove from the air, and could this help forestall  global warming?

"There is concern about increasing levels of carbon dioxide in  the atmosphere," Garrison says. "We don't know how much is taken  out of the air by these blooms of plants and how much gets down  into the deep water via the food web. If a lot of carbon does sink  into deep water, it can be sequestered there for hundreds of years."

Garrison and Gowing, associate research biological  oceanographers at UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, are veterans  of Antarctic studies. The latest cruise, which lasted from November  3 to December 10, was the seventh for Garrison and the third for  Gowing. They were aboard the Nathaniel B. Palmer, a research vessel  chartered by the National Science Foundation as part of its U.S.  Antarctic Program. This cruise was marked by relatively mild  conditions (near 20 degrees F), few storms, hordes of penguins and  seals, and lots of 20-hour days. "It was very tiring," Garrison says.  "We worked essentially the entire time we were there."

Departing from New Zealand, the ship took a week to reach the  Ross Sea's 300-mile-wide "polynya," an area of open water  surrounded by ice. The aim was to catch the start of the annual  bloom of phytoplankton--tiny algae on the menu of krill and other  small animals, which in turn fortify fish, penguins, whales, and the  rest. Scientists on previous cruises had seen only the height of this  planktonic eruption, in December and January. As it turns out, even  the latest cruise wasn't early enough: The water already was full of  chlorophyll when the ship arrived. Researchers now think the  plankton may start to thrive in October or even in late September,  under the steadying influence of a thin layer of ice that lets sunlight  filter through.

Even with the bloom well under way, Garrison and Gowing had  no trouble meeting their goals. They collected huge amounts of  Phaeocystis, a type of algae that begins life as single cells. During  blooms, the cells form free-floating colonies that may include  thousands of cells in a gooey matrix. Later, the colonies break apart.  Colonies that aren't eaten appear to sink to the bottom, dragging  carbon with them. In one part of the Ross Sea, the scientists found  that the dominant plants were diatoms, a different kind of algae  that uses silica to form glassy shells.

During three excursions across the polynya, the team took  water samples at various depths, brought up organisms with gentle  nets, and used traps to collect living and dead material drifting  down through the water. They studied some of the samples on board  with a technique that makes the chlorophyll in plant cells glow  under a microscope. Most of the analysis, however, will occur during  painstaking lab work over the next two years. Garrison and Gowing  will use electron microscopy and other methods to measure the  abundance of different organisms, estimate how much carbon they  carry, and tease out the fine details of the food web.

"It boils down to a lot of counting," says Gowing. "Much of the  work is to see who's feeding on whom. It's not a simple food web-- there seem to be as many interesting and diverse relationships  among species here as there are in tropical waters. The more we  look, the more we find."

The ultimate goal is to create a model of the annual cycles of  carbon in the Southern Ocean. Biological, geological, and chemical  processes all move carbon among land, sea, and air. Researchers  cannot understand the big picture about these critical cycles  without knowing how the smallest but most common organisms use  carbon, and what happens to the carbon once they die.

Further, a better grasp of the biology of these life-forms will  help researchers look for the effects of the ozone "hole." From May  to October each year, industrial chemicals in the air deplete the  ozone over Antarctica, letting more ultraviolet light reach the  ground and ocean. Scientists theorize that single-celled plants and  animals at the heart of the food web could feel the brunt of the  damage caused by extra UV light--but finding evidence of that will  take time.

Evelyn Lessard, a biological oceanographer at the University of  Washington, is a coprincipal investigator with Gowing and Garrison  on their NSF-funded study.
