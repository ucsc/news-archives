KZSC has extended its 25th Anniversary Pledge Drive until Monday, June 1. The campus radio station, located at 88.1 FM on the radio dial, has also doubled its fund-raising goal to $50,000.

KZSC had orginally planned to end its drive on Friday, May 22. This year's fund-raising drive, which started May 11, marks the station's 25th year of broadcasting.

Funds raised during the drive will support plans to replace an aging transmitter and upgrade broadcast equipment. To make a pledge, call (408) 459-2811, 459-4734, or 459-4036.
