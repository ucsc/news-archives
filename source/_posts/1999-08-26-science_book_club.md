## Science Book Club Will Discuss The Power And Poetry Of Mathematics

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Science Matters Book Club, which meets each month at the Central Branch of the Santa Cruz Public Library, holds its next meeting on Sunday, September 26, from 2 to 4 p.m. Glenn Millhauser, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, will lead a discussion of Michael Guillen's book "Five Equations That Changed the World: The Power and Poetry of Mathematics."

The book club is open to the general public and focuses on nontechnical science books. Each discussion is led by a member of the local scientific community with expertise in the subject of that month's book. Meetings are usually on the third Sunday of each month.

The book club is sponsored by the Santa Cruz Public Libraries, the UC Santa Cruz Science Library, the Cabrillo College Library, the Association for Women in Science - Monterey Bay, the Capitola Book Cafe, and the Santa Cruz City Museum of Natural History. The Capitola Book Cafe offers a 10 percent discount to members of the book club for the monthly selections.

"This book club was created to provide a forum for readers of lay science books to be able to ask questions of professionals in the field," said Victoria Welborn, reference librarian at the UCSC Science Library. "It also provides a forum for scientists to discuss their work with nonscientists."
