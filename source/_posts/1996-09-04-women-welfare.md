SANTA CRUZ, CA--Gwendolyn Mink, a professor of politics at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, has been honored by her peers  for her recent book on women and welfare policy.

Mink received the Victoria Schuck Award from the American  Political Science Association for her book The Wages of Motherhood:  Inequality in the Welfare State, 1917-1942 (Ithaca, NY: Cornell  University Press, 1995). The Schuck Award recognizes the best book  on women in politics published during the previous calendar year. It  was presented during the association's annual meeting at the award  ceremony on August 30; it carries a $500 cash prize.

Mink is an authority on American politics; she specializes in  welfare policy and feminist politics. Her book examines the ways in  which welfare policy that was established during the first half of  this century reinforced existing patterns of gender and racial  inequality. Forged by such stars of feminist history as Jane Addams,  Florence Kelley, and Frances Perkins, those policies were laden with  cultural and racial bias in a way that structured inequality among  women into the welfare state, says Mink.

Although the reformers made important gains, their welfare  innovations were based on the belief that certain women were  inferior mothers and needed the guidance of government, says Mink.  Their policies linked maternity with dependence, poverty with  cultural weakness, and need with moral failing--all of which are  evident in the current debate over welfare. "Welfare politics are  very much informed by welfare history," says Mink, who calls  President Clinton's approval of welfare reform "a betrayal of all  women."
