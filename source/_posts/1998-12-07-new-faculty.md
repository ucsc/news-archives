**Ingrid Parker:** Assistant Professor of Biology

Ingrid Parker studies plant ecology and the biology of species invasions. She focuses on mutualistic interactions between species, such as pollination of plants by insects, and antagonistic interactions, such as disease, to understand what roles these interactions play in the distribution and characteristics of plants. Parker applies her work to conservation issues, especially the spread of exotic weeds into natural areas. She does research both in the tropics and in California. Parker received her A.B. degree in biology from the University of Chicago and her Ph.D. in botany from the University of Washington in Seattle. Before joining the UCSC faculty, she held a Miller Postdoctoral Fellowship at UC Berkeley.
