## UC Santa Cruz Farm Offers Classes On Herbs For Home Gardeners

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Join local herb expert Darren Huckle for a four-hour workshop on medicinal and culinary herbs on Saturday, May 1, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Many common herbal remedies can be successfully grown, prepared, and used by the home gardener. There are also many herbs that commonly appear in local gardens. This class will focus on how to choose, grow, and use herbs from your garden.

Huckle, a graduate of the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, will cover plant identification, preparing and planting herb beds, and cultural requirements of common herbs.

The class will meet at the Louise Cain Gatehouse on the UCSC Farm. The fee is $25 for the general public; $20 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden. Preregistration is required; call John Fisher at (831) 459-3248 or send e-mail to johnfish@cats.ucsc.edu.

The Gatehouse is located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available across the street from the Blacksmith Shop in the Physical Plant parking lot.

The class is being offered by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems with support from the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden.
