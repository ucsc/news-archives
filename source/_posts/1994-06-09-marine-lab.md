SANTA CRUZ, CA--K-12 science teachers are invited to enroll in  "Bringing Marine Science to the Classroom," a two-day workshop at  the Long Marine Laboratory, a coastal research station run by the  University of California, Santa Cruz. Participants will learn how to  integrate current marine-science research into their classroom  activities at the workshop, which is set for August 1 and 2.

Each morning, UCSC researchers will present current  scientific information from fields such as oceanography, coastal  processes and geology, environmental toxicology, and marine- mammal studies. In the afternoon, teachers will convene by grade  level to learn practical "take back to the classroom" lab activities  modeled after the research.

Participants will visit the lab's facilities and will have the  opportunity to join a new group of marine-science mentor teachers  for continuing programs during the school year.

The registration fee is $90, with a deadline of June 30. Early  registration is advised, as enrollment is limited to 35 teachers.  Continuing education credit is available through UCSC Extension for  an additional fee of $35.

For more information or registration forms, call the Long  Marine Lab's education office at 459-3854 or 459-2358.
