**Barry Sinervo**  

Assistant Professor of Biology  

Barry Sinervo, a behavioral ecologist, uses the common side-blotched lizard as a model system to study the fascinating ways in which animal behavior and hormonal systems can dictate evolution and sexual selection. He received acclaim for a recent paper in Nature that described "rock-scissors-paper" mating strategies among male lizards at his study site near Los Banos. Sinervo was on the faculty at Indiana University before coming to UCSC. He earned his B.S. in biology and mathematics from Dalhousie University and his Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Washington.
