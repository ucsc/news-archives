SANTA CRUZ, CA--University Police sergeant Nancy Carroll of the University  of California, Santa Cruz, graduated September 12 from the FBI National  Academy in Quantico, Virginia.

The 11-week academy offers advanced investigative, management, and  fitness training to upper- and mid-level law enforcement managers around  the world. It also provides an opportunity for the officers to share ideas,  techniques, and experiences.

FBI director Louis J. Freeh delivered the keynote address at the  September 12 commencement ceremonies. Carroll was one of more than 267  officers to graduate.

Carroll joined UC Santa Cruz as a police officer in 1984 after working  for the UCLA and city of San Jose police departments. She was promoted to  sergeant in 1989.
