**Chancellor Greenwood** was quoted in a lengthy _San Jose Mercury News_ article on how the decline of federal research funding affects Bay Area science and technology. "Most of us in the science policy field think we're right on the edge of making some serious mistakes here," stated the chancellor, who has been part of a lobbying campaign on behalf of federal science funding. According to the _Mercury News,_ UCSC is among the top 10 institutional and corporate recipients of federal research grants in the Bay Area.

ABC's _Nightline_ sent a camera crew to campus to film sociologist **Craig Reinarman** for a recent segment on how advertising and the media create demand for consciousness-altering chemicals. Reinarman, an expert on drugs and drug policy, helped producers explore the link between the popularity and promotion of alcohol, tobacco, over-the-counter, and prescription drugs and the use of illegal drugs. Simplistic antidrug messages don't acknowledge the widespread use--and social acceptability--of alcohol and tobacco, said Reinarman.

San Francisco's KRON-TV featured UCSC Farm staffers **Sean Swezey, Ann Lindsey,** and **Kathi Colen** in their recent two-part series about organic farming. The UCSC segment showcased Swezey's work with local apple growers, as well as composting and cover cropping techniques and the growing movement known as community-supported agriculture.

Manuel Pastor of Latin American and Latino studies was quoted in a _New York Times_ story about job creation in inner-city Los Angeles in the wake of the 1992 riots. Pastor advocates a regional approach to urban renewal, saying that inner-city residents should have access to jobs anywhere in the region and that public policy should support such access.

Professor emeritus **David Thomas** of politics discussed his coming out experience with Peggy Townsend of the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ for a story she wrote in conjunction with the media-hyped coming-out episode of the TV sit-com _Ellen._ Also interviewed were literature's **Earl Jackson, Danny Scheie** of theater arts, and undergraduate **Michael Stevens.**
