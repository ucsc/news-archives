**"Active Galactic Nuclei" Is The Illuminating Topic For May 12 Talk**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Faculty members at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, have chosen astronomer Donald E. Osterbrock, one of the  campus's most accomplished scientists, to deliver UCSC's 31st  annual Faculty Research Lecture. The honor, which recognizes  outstanding research achievements, is the highest that faculty may  bestow upon their colleagues.

Osterbrock will give his talk, "Active Galactic Nuclei:  Lighthouses in the Universe," at 8 p.m. Monday, May 12, in the new  Music Center Recital Hall at UCSC. The lecture is free and open to  the public. A reception will follow in the Crown College Provost's  House.

Osterbrock came to Santa Cruz in 1973 and served as director  of Lick Observatory from then until 1981. He is now professor  emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics and astronomer emeritus at  UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. He maintains an active research  program and has gained renown for several recent books on the  history of American astronomy.

In selecting Osterbrock, UCSC's Academic Senate cited his  "extraordinarily important and influential" contributions to a wide  range of disciplines within astronomy. Early in his career, he  focused on theoretical models of the internal structure of the sun.  This work helped astronomers understand the structures of stars in  general and led to the first detailed and satisfactory models of  evolved stars, such as red giants and supergiants. His subsequent  theoretical work on the sun helped demonstrate why the sun's outer  atmosphere is far hotter than its surface.

Osterbrock's midcareer work led to fundamental insights into  the nature of gaseous nebulae, gas-filled regions of space between  stars that shine--often with spectacular beauty--as a result of  stars embedded in them. Osterbrock used detailed theoretical data  on the structures of atoms to explain the likely chemical  compositions of the nebulae as well as heating and cooling  processes that occur.

His later research, especially after coming to Lick  Observatory, explored the extraordinarily powerful nuclei of active  galaxies--the subject of his Faculty Research Lecture. As the talk's  title implies, active galactic nuclei act as beacons that astronomers  can detect across vast reaches of the universe. These objects emit  copious amounts of energy at many different wavelengths, from  radio waves and x-rays to infrared, optical, and ultraviolet light.  Frequently, active galaxies propel incredible "jets" of matter and  energy from their centers in one or more directions. Research by  Osterbrock and others has shown that the most likely sources of  such outbursts are disks of dust and gas spiraling into the maws of  massive black holes. Indeed, recent studies with the Hubble Space  Telescope have strengthened that theory.

Osterbrock's numerous books include a classic research  monograph, Astrophysics of Gaseous Nebulae and Active Galactic  Nuclei, widely used as a text and reference book in the field. His  historical volumes include biographies of astronomer James Keeler  and telescope maker George Willis Ritchey, as well as noted reviews  of the histories of Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin and Lick  Observatory, which UCSC now operates.

Scientific societies have recognized Osterbrock's career with  nearly all of the kudos that an American astronomer can accrue. He  is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American  Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical  Society. He has received the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship from  the American Astronomical Society and the Catherine Wolfe Bruce  Medal from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, both in honor of  lifetime achievement in the field. Most recently, Great Britain's  Royal Astronomical Society awarded Osterbrock its 1997 Gold  Medal, an honor he will accept in the fall.

Osterbrock's faculty peers at UCSC also noted that he has  supervised the work of more than 20 Ph.D. recipients in astronomy,  many of whom have gone on to become leaders in research and at  observatories. "In summary," the Academic Senate stated, "Professor  Osterbrock's contributions to scientific research in a variety of  fields, his leadership in the scientific community, and his deep  involvement in the educational process have led him to become one  of the world's outstanding figures in the field of astronomy in the  second half of the 20th century."

Osterbrock earned his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. at the University of  Chicago. Before joining UCSC's faculty, he held positions at  Princeton University, Caltech, and the University of Wisconsin. The  Ohio State University and the University of Chicago both have  granted honorary doctoral degrees to Osterbrock; he will receive a  third such degree from another noted institution just four days after  delivering his Faculty Research Lecture.
