Seventy-five Physical Plant employees and friends gathered at the Women's Center in September for a party to honor **Jim Hagler's** 25 years of service to the university. Vice Chancellor Tom Vani presented Hagler, who is director of Physical Plant, with his 25-year pin and a letter of congratulations. Chancellor Greenwood was there as well to thank Hagler for his years of service. Pictured here is Hagler (left) with Jim West, a senior supervisor on Hagler's staff.
