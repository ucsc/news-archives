title: Public Donations Will Fund Repair Of Historic Dome At Lick Observatory

**Observatory Also Will Offer Its Annual "music Of The Spheres" Concert  Series And Will Restore Its Popular Summer Visitors Program For  Five Nights In 1997**

MT. HAMILTON, CA--Officials at the University of California, Santa  Cruz, will soon repair the dome housing Lick Observatory's historic  36-inch refracting telescope, thanks in part to an extraordinary  public response to news reports on a portion of the dome that leaks  in wet weather.

To date, the observatory has received about $38,500 in  donations earmarked to restore the 109-year-old structure, more  than twice the goal of $18,000 for materials to fix the leaks and  repaint the dome. About 250 donors have contributed money, mainly  from northern California but also from seven other states--the  result of Internet and wire services running the story nationally.

"We were surprised and gratified by the public response to the  articles," said Joseph Miller, director of UC Observatories/Lick  Observatory and professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC  Santa Cruz. The contributions will pay for materials and will allow  the observatory to hire temporary help to repair the dome this  summer, Miller noted. If any funds remain, the observatory will  direct them toward public-safety improvements inside the dome,  including new fire exits and handrails.

Miller emphasized that the observatory did not intend to launch  a public campaign. Rather, observatory staff solicited contributions  from visitors via a sign in the lobby of the main building. A San Jose  Mercury News reporter noticed the sign and wrote an article about  the dome; other news organizations followed suit the next day.

"Unfortunately, these articles created the impression that the  observatory has no funds for necessary repairs," Miller said. "On the  contrary, we do have funds for maintenance, but we devote them to  higher priority repairs that affect the research mission of Lick  Observatory. These leaks are in an area used almost entirely for  public programs, rather than research." The leaks do not threaten the  structural integrity of the dome or the historic instruments inside,  Miller added.

Although it is a popular tourist stop, the observatory serves  primarily as a forefront research institution for University of  California astronomers, Miller said. Its principal instrument, the  120-inch Shane Telescope, opened in 1959 and remains one of the  world's most productive telescopes. For instance, astronomers used  it and a sophisticated light-analyzing tool, the Hamilton  Spectrograph, to find evidence of several new planets last year.

Public programs at Lick Observatory have grown increasingly  popular since the observatory moved its headquarters to UC Santa  Cruz in 1966. For two decades, a Summer Visitors Program attracted  thousands of people each year to view the heavens and hear lectures.  However, university budget shortfalls forced the observatory to  cancel the free programs in 1991.

This year, the observatory will restore its Summer Visitors  Program on five Friday nights in June, July, and August. "We  recognize the growing interest in astronomy," Miller said, "and we  intend to continue expanding this visitors program with time."

In addition, the observatory will continue its Music of the  Spheres summer concert series, also on five nights. Space is  limited; tickets for both events are available by mail only on a  first-come, first-served basis.

The Summer Visitors Program will take place on June 27, July 11, July 25, August 8, and August 22. Ticket orders must  indicate the number of tickets requested (up to a maximum of six)  and rank each date in order of preference. Mail ticket requests with  a self-addressed, stamped envelope to: Summer Visitors Program,  P.O. Box 85, Mt. Hamilton, CA 95140.

Music of the Spheres concerts are scheduled for July 19,  August 15 and 16, and September 12 and 13. Each evening includes an  astronomy lecture and viewing through telescopes. Tickets are $30  each; special benefactor seats are available for contributions of  $100 or more. Proceeds benefit the observatory's public programs. A  flyer listing the concerts and speakers is available by mail from:  Concert, P.O. Box 85, Mt. Hamilton, CA 95140.

The visitors center at Lick Observatory is open to the public  from 12:30 to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on  Saturdays and Sundays. For recorded information, call (408) 274-5061.
