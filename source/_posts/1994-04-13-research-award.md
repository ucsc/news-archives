SANTA CRUZ, CA--Frank Talamantes, professor of biology at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, has received the 1993 "SSR  Research Award" from the Society for the Study of Reproduction. The  award, which recognizes outstanding research during the past six  years, is one of the top honors for scientists who study the  hormones involved in the reproductive process.

Talamantes was chosen for his laboratory's pioneering work on  a family of hormones that includes growth hormones and placental  lactogens. These substances play key roles in several vital  processes during pregnancy, including the growth of the fetus and  the development of the mother's mammary glands. Using  progressively more complex studies involving mice, Talamantes's  group has earned an international reputation for identifying the  stuctures of the hormones and many of their functions. This basic  research has applications to studies of health problems during and  after human pregnancy, such as miscarriages and inability to nurse.

In the last six years, Talamantes and his colleagues have  published more than 60 scientific articles. "Studies from Dr.  Talamantes' laboratory have been comprehensive, spanning the entire  realm of modern reproductive endocrinology work," states the award  citation. "The significance of his accomplishments is not only in the  volume of work, but also in its quality."

The society also praised the mentoring skills that Talamantes  has displayed in training numerous young scientists, both at the  graduate and undergraduate level, and his special contributions to  fostering the research careers of students from ethnic minority  groups.

Talamantes received his B.A. from the University of St. Thomas  in Houston, his M.A. from Sam Houston State University in Huntsville,  Texas, and his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. He joined the UCSC faculty in  1974.
