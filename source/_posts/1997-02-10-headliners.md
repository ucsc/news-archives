UCSC astronomers in the news: January witnessed a burst of media coverage of the pioneering work at UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. At a meeting in Toronto, postdoctoral researcher **James Lowentha**l met the press at a news conference about the "Hubble Deep Field," the Hubble Space Telescope's most probing view yet into the far reaches of the universe. The Associated Press and Scripps-Howard News Service carried Lowenthal's comments across the country. . . . Reporting on the same meeting, the _San Francisco Chronicle_ mentioned **Sandy Faber's** role as a member of a team using Hubble to reveal that a black hole probably exists at the core of every galaxy. . . . On the ground, **Steve Vogt** has joined a Keck observatory team--led by alumnus **Geoffrey Marcy**\--to extend the search for planets around nearby stars. The _Washington Post_ spoke with Vogt at length about the technical wizardry needed for the search to succeed. . . . Finally, **Michael Bolte,** gaining renown as an expert on the ages of the oldest stars, penned a commentary for _Nature_ about the most ancient denizen of the Milky Way yet studied--not U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, but rather a star whose age may lie between 13 and 21 billion years.

Arts dean **Ed Houghton** has spent a lot of time with area media recently, discussing the newly opened Music Center. In recent weeks he's been quoted in the _San Jose Mercury News, Santa Cruz County Sentinel,_ and _City on a Hill Press._ Architect **Frank Zwart** also spoke about the Music Center for a segment on KSBW Channel 8.

**Laura Mitchell,** who came to UCSC this year from the University of Dallas to coach the women's basketball team, described in a profile in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ her impressions of UCSC. "There is a completely different type of personality here, there's no snobbiness, the kids are friendlier," Mitchell said. "In Dallas they wanted a male coach, they would never consider a single mom a good role model." Mitchell, who has a three-year-old son, says she loves coaching despite the long hours and meager pay and predicts the Slugs will make the Division III playoffs in three years.

The transport of toxin-laden mud from Richmond, California, to Mobile, Arizona, prompted residents of those communities to form a unique alliance that ultimately changed public policy. In a story in the _Valley Times_ of Pleasanton, **Manuel Pastor** of Latin American and Latino studies, who studies environmental justice, said he'd never before heard of a successful partnership between residents of two towns who fought back--and won.

**Susan Friedman** took her UCSC photography class to Half Moon Bay in October. The _Half Moon Bay Review_ liked the photos so much that they showcased a number of them in a full-page spread in December.
