title: M.R.C. Greenwood Inaugurated As UCSC's Seventh Chancellor

While forcing a last-minute change of venue, cloudy skies and intermittent rain didn't dampen the enthusiasm last week when M.R.C. Greenwood was inaugurated as UCSC's seventh chancellor.

Rain brings out the sun-shy banana slug and, in many cultures, is considered a sign of good luck, Greenwood said to the inaugural audience on Friday, May 23. "I hope it will be an omen for the very wonderful things that will come." 

The rain soaked the seats in the Upper Quarry Amphitheater, forcing event organizers to make a last-minute decision to move the ceremony to the East Field House. More than 800 people filled the basketball gym and 150 more watched the event live at Kresge Town Hall.

The rain began again in earnest as the processional commenced just after 12:30 p.m.

Dressed in gowns, mortarboards, tassels, and hoods ranging in color from silver gray to peacock blue, delegates from sister educational institutions, students, alumni, and other representatives joined 170 of UCSC's faculty and staff marching in the ceremony.

Speakers at the event included UC President Richard C. Atkinson, who inaugurated the chancellor; Santa Cruz Mayor Cynthia Mathews; UC Santa Barbara Chancellor Henry Yang; and alumna and former astronaut Kathryn Sullivan. Many lauded the chancellor for her energy and enthusiasm.

"From your first day at UC Santa Cruz, you hit the ground running," said Cabrillo College President John Hurd. "We're amazed how, from a dead run, you seemed to accelerate almost from day one."

"We welcome your efforts to understand our City on the Hill," said Kathleen Flint, Graduate Student Association president. "You've been learning about our campus, our spirit, our sacred cows and, no doubt, our sacred slugs."

Tirso del Junco, chairman of the Regents, read a message from Leon Panetta, President Clinton's former chief of staff, who was unable to attend the event. Panetta was to be the keynote speaker, but decided Friday morning not to cross picket lines erected at the base of campus by the UPTE/CWA union.

"The key to the success of this campus is that it has never forgotten its humanity," said Panetta in his message. Congratulating Greenwood and wishing her success as UCSC's chancellor, Panetta also entreated her to continue to build upon that foundation.

Bestowing Greenwood with the Chancellor's Medal, UC President Richard Atkinson reflected on the task she faces as UCSC's chancellor.

"It is the job of the chancellor to live simultaneously in the demanding realities of the present and the beckoning dreams of the future," he said. "I can't think of anyone better able to face this challenge than this chancellor."

After the event, Greenwood said it was an "incredible testimony" to UCSC staff that inauguration organizers were able to successfully change venues for the event so quickly. "This was an amazing demonstration of staff resilience."

She expressed disappointment that moving the event meant that some who wanted to attend were forced to watch it in simulcast from Kresge Town Hall.

One staff member who watched the simulcast said it was perhaps even more fun than being at the actual event.

"We had a great time," said Steve Miller, operations manager for the arts. "People watching were clapping as people came on screen....We felt very involved."
