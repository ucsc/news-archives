**Training and Development**

The human resources training and development program has been expanded this fall to encompass a range of computer training classes that cover everything from introductory word processing to advanced data management.

The extensive offering is largely a result of the hire last spring of full-time instructor Bonita Sebastian, who is pleased to report that classes are consistently filling up.

"What we've been able to do is lower the cost of the courses and expand the curricula offered. Most classes have about 15 students, so there's time for personal attention," noted Sebastian, who is HR's technical training coordinator. "We're eager to meet whatever training needs units on campus have."

In addition to offering classes year-round, one of the unique services HR is now able to offer is custom classes. "We are beginning to see a demand for custom classes," she said. "Individuals or units can simply call or send e-mail to request a class. We really want to be able to respond to the technical training needs of staff."

Among the most popular classes are FileMaker Pro and Microsoft Excel, said Sebastian.

HR's computer labs are located in Kerr Hall.

**New, improved Human Resources Web pages**

Human Resources has upgraded its Web pages to provide greater services and information on academic and staff human resources, labor relations, benefits, EEO/AA and diversity education, sexual harassment/Title IX, the payroll personnel system, and training and development. Along with general information, visitors to these pages may now download certain applications.
