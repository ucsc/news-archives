SANTA CRUZ, CA--Flower bouquets bring the beauty of the garden  indoors and help brighten any space. Growing your own bouquet  ingredients will be the topic of a free two-hour workshop on  Saturday, May 30, from 10 a.m. to noon at San Lorenzo Lumber's  Garden Center, 235 River Street, Santa Cruz.

Orin Martin, manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden at UC Santa  Cruz, will gear his talk to the beginning gardener interested in  growing great cut flowers. Martin will discuss the major features of  many annual and perennial flower varieties that can flourish in  home garden settings. He'll give tips on harvesting techniques and  postharvest care to ensure a longer vase life and offer a list of his  "greatest hits" for the Monterey Bay region.

"The home gardener has fewer constraints than commercial  growers when it comes to growing bouquet ingredients," says Martin,  who has managed the historic Chadwick Garden for more than 20  years. "That opens up a wide range of plants that can be grown for  cutting." His springtime favorites include agrostemma, larkspur,  sweet peas, perennial cornflowers, delphinium, and annual  gypsophyllum. He'll discuss these and more at the workshop, offering  ideas for both bedding and border plantings.

The free talk is sponsored by the UCSC Center for Agroecology  and Sustainable Food Systems and the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden.
