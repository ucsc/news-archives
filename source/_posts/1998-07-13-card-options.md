Two production notes:  
* The U.S. Post Office requests  the "1156 High Street" addition to campus addresses.
* The area of the card designed for a  World Wide Web address (URL) will default to the campus  address (www.ucs.edu) unless office or personal home page extensions are added to that address or unless a URL not using the campus's Web address is specified.
