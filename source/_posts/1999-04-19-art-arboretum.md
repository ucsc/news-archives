This May Day (Saturday, May 1), come try your hand at Chinese brush painting, see gourd carving and Ikebana flower arranging, or stroll past garden art at the UCSC Arboretum. The "Art in the Arboretum" celebration will feature sculptures of bronze, rock, ceramic, and wrought

iron near the gift shop and in the garden. Displays of pique assiette, paper cutouts, botanical illustration, and a watercolor show by a group from the Santa Cruz Water Color Society add to the display. Though the watercolors are not for sale, the majority of the art will be.

The event--held in celebration of the fifth anniversary of Norrie's Gift Shop--is free and open to the public. It takes place from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Norrie's Gift Shop at the Arboretum, located on High St. between the east and west entrances to the UCSC campus.

The event includes a demonstration of Ikebana flower arranging, starting at 2 p.m. in the Horticulture Building. The demonstration by Fusako Hoyrup, president of the Wafu School of Ikebana, California chapter, will use unusual material gathered at the Arboretum. Hoyrup has given lectures on Ikebana in India, Australia, South Africa, Brazil, Denmark, and the U.S.

"Norrie's Gifts is proud to present the art pieces of Liza Muhly, gourd artist extraordinaire," added Shirley Beneke, founding member of Norrie's, which was founded by and is staffed by volunteers. "They are on display and for sale at the gift shop. Ms. Muhly will be featured showing some of her techniques for carving, painting, and preserving gourds."

Other how-to demonstrations will also be offered, including a workshop in Chinese brush painting taught by Dana Gibson of Cabrillo College.

The Arboretum is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Norrie's Gifts is open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and on Sundays from 1 to 4 p.m. The Jean and Bill Lane Horticultural Library is open Wednesdays through Sundays from 1 to 4 p.m.
