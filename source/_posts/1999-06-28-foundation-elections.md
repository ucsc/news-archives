SANTA CRUZ, CA--The UC Santa Cruz Foundation has elected Paul Irwin of Watsonville as president of the board and David Regan of Santa Cruz as vice president. The foundation promotes and supports academic programs, scholarships and fellowships, and capital improvements at UCSC through its private fund-raising efforts.

The two took over leadership of the 49-member board effective June 4. Their terms are for two years.

Retired from McCormick & Co., Inc., a distributor of spices and flavorings worldwide, Irwin has been involved in numerous volunteer activities, including service for the Washington D.C.- based Citizens Network for Foreign Affairs, providing technical and marketing assistance about food and agricultural issues to countries making up the former Soviet Union. Locally, he has been active as president of the Rotary Club of Watsonville and has served on an advisory board for Watsonville Hospital.

Irwin is also a strong supporter of education. On the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, he is providing support to the fund-raising campaign for the Seymour Marine Discovery Center at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory while also serving on the foundation's Capital Projects Committee. In other educational activities, Irwin is a trustee of the Putney School in Vermont and is a member of the Thomas Jefferson Society of the Alumni of the University of Virginia.

"I admire the leadership of the university provided by Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood," Irwin said. "She has provided appropriate and challenging goals for the foundation, and I look forward to active involvement with fellow trustees during the coming two years."

Regan is publisher and former general manager of the Santa Cruz County Sentinel. In addition to his work with the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, he is currently president of the Santa Cruz County Business Council and has served as president of United Way of Santa Cruz County, the Santa Cruz unit of the American Cancer Society, and the Santa Cruz Host Lions Club. He is also a member of the boards of the Dominican Foundation and of Delta School, a charter school located on the UCSC campus.
