The University of California Board of Regents, acting on President  Richard C. Atkinson's recommendation, named M.R.C. "Marci"  Greenwood chancellor of UC Santa Cruz during a special meeting  today (Tuesday, April 9) by teleconference.

A nationally respected scholar and dean of graduate studies  and vice provost for academic outreach at UC Davis, Greenwood, 53,  is the seventh chancellor of UC Santa Cruz, succeeding Karl S.  Pister, who will retire in June. She was selected following  nationwide search by an advisory committee composed of Regents,  faculty, students, staff, and representatives of the UC Santa Cruz  Alumni Association and UC Santa Cruz Foundation.

Greenwood's salary, which was approved in open session, will  be $173,200. She will assume her new post on July 1.

"With her expertise and insight into the importance of federal  funding of research and her skills as a campus leader and strategic  thinker, M.R.C. Greenwood is uniquely well suited to lead the Santa  Cruz campus," Atkinson said.

Clair Burgener, chairman of the Board of Regents, praised  Greenwood's appointment saying, "She is highly intelligent,  eminently accomplished in science, education, and administration,  and a keen judge of people."

"I am very pleased to learn of the Board of Regents' selection  today of Dr. Greenwood as the seventh Chancellor of UC Santa Cruz,"  added Chancellor Pister. "Dr. Greenwood will bring to the campus a  combination of administrative and teaching experience together  with a distinguished record of scholarly accomplishment. In  addition, she offers the asset of recent experience in science and  technology policy in the executive branch in Washington, D.C. I am  confident that she will be an effective leader to bring the campus  into the 21st century."

Greenwood said, "The University of California at Santa Cruz is  a jewel in the finest research university system in the world. I am  greatly honored to be named its seventh chancellor. UCSC began  with a recognition that a true education stimulates both the mind  and the spirit. UCSC's distinctive blend of superb faculty,  outstanding research opportunities, an unsurpassable physical  setting, and devoted attention to students and the learning  environment make it unique. Our challenge, working together, will be  to move into the next century with dedication to our innovative  roots and with fresh approaches to the increasingly challenging  times for public higher education. I eagerly anticipate working with  the UCSC faculty, students, staff, alumni, and friends."

From December 1993 to May 1995, Greenwood took a leave of  absence from her duties at UC Davis to serve as associate director  for science in the White House Office of Science and Technology  Policy. In that position, she advised the Clinton administration on  issues related to national budgetary priorities and federal  investment in fundamental scientific research.

As dean of graduate studies at Davis since 1989, Greenwood is  responsible for approximately 80 departmental and  interdepartmental programs. She also participates in the  development of training grants and has responsibility for the  postdoctoral programs of the Davis campus. As vice provost, she  leads the UC Davis innovative Internet-based university outreach  program and oversees University Extension, summer sessions and a  variety of other outreach-oriented units.

Elected in 1992 to the Institute of Medicine of the National  Academy of Sciences, Greenwood has served as an officer in several  scientific disciplinary societies and policy-making boards and is the  recipient of numerous honors and awards.

Greenwood graduated summa cum laude from Vassar College  with a bachelor's degree in biology in 1968. She received her  doctorate in physiology, developmental biology, and neurosciences  from Rockefeller University in 1973.

She was an assistant professor of human genetics and  development at Columbia University from 1976 to 1978. From 1978  to 1981, Greenwood was associate professor of biology at Vassar  College, and she served as professor and chair of the biology  department and as John Guy Vassar Professor of Natural Sciences  from 1986-89.

Greenwood joined UC Davis in 1989 as dean of graduate studies  and professor of nutrition and internal medicine.

Founded in 1965, UC Santa Cruz has approximately 10,000  students and is the home of the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory  and the site of several nationally renowned research centers,  including the Institute of Marine Sciences and the Institute of  Tectonics.

In a survey released last fall by the National Research Council,  two of UCSC's doctoral programs were ranked in the top 10 in the  nation, astronomy and astrophysics (6th) and linguistics (10th). Two  other programs--earth sciences, and biochemistry and molecular  biology--also placed in the top 25 percent.

Santa Cruz's faculty includes 12 members of the National  Academy of Sciences, 17 members of the American Academy of Arts  and Sciences; four Kellogg Fellows; one MacArthur Fellow; and one  member of the National Academy of Engineering.
