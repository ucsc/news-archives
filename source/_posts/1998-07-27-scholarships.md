title: Eleven Students Receive $20,000 Scholarships To Attend UCSC

Eleven talented students from regional community colleges have been awarded $20,000 scholarships to attend UCSC. Recipients receive $10,000 scholarships for each of two years, the support of a strong academic mentoring program, and assistance finding paid summer work experience in a field that complements their studies.

Now in its sixth year, the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards Program has helped dozens of community college transfer students realize their dream of a university education.

"For many people in California, our community colleges open an important door to higher education, and the people who receive these scholarships each year see that opening as an opportunity," said Chancellor Greenwood. "These eleven students have worked hard to get into this position, and we are very pleased to reward their effort with scholarships to the University of California, Santa Cruz."

The scholarship program was established in 1993 by former chancellor Karl S. Pister to increase opportunities for talented community college students who want to transfer to UCSC.

The scholarships recognize students who have overcome adverse socioeconomic circumstances, who have a demonstrated commitment to assisting and improving the lives of others, and who might not otherwise be able to attend UCSC for financial reasons. Candidates are nominated by the presidents of each of 13 regional community colleges, and recipients are selected by Greenwood in consultation with the Leadership Opportunity Awards Program Screening Committee.

Up to 13 recipients are selected each year. A $5.2 million endowment is being established to fund the program permanently. Named scholarships honor contributors of major gifts to the program. A gift of $10,000 establishes a named scholarship for one year; an endowment of $200,000 creates a permanent named scholarship.
