**Juan Poblete:** Assistant Professor of Literature

Juan Poblete's focus is on Latin American literature with an emphasis on the history and social contexts of literature. He has studied the emergence of literary markets in Chile, the role subaltern readers play in influencing markets, and how cultural values influence curricular choices in schools, for example, the historical contexts of the recent downsizing of the humanities. Poblete earned his B.A. from the University of Chile and a Ph.D. from Duke University.
