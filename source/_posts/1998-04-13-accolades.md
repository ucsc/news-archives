**Robert Fairlie,** assistant professor of economics, was invited to speak at the Department of the Treasury in Washington, D.C., on his research on race, immigration, and business ownership. The presentation of his research was part of the Treasury Department's efforts to promote racial equality and understanding through President Clinton's Initiative on Race. . . . Fairlie was also asked by lawyers from the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund to help them interpret results from a report assessing New Jersey's Family Cap Policy, which places a ceiling on the amount of welfare benefits individuals may receive. NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund is working on a class-action suit against the state of New Jersey to declare the Family Cap Policy unconstitutional under the state's constitution. Fairlie's working papers can be found at econ.ucsc.edu/~fairlie/.
