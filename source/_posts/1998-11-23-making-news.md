Sociologist **Andy Szasz** cautioned readers of the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ against being overly optimistic regarding a new report that documented a reduction of toxic emissions in the county between 1988 and 1996. Statewide, emissions are actually up, he said, but the materials are being transported to landfills and treatment plants rather than being released directly into the air.

The news of a gift from library cataloger **Rolf Augustine** to the University Library received ink in several publications, including the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel,_ the _Register Pajaronian,_ and the _Library Journal._

An article in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ about the late Don Gholston, a well-known local gardener and long-time volunteer at the UCSC Arboretum, featured Arboretum manager **Brett Hall.** On a visit to Gholston's garden with _Sentinel_ staff writer Kathy Kreiger and nurseryman Jeff Rosendale, Hall commented on Gholston's passion for horticulture and his contributions to the Arboretum and to the California Rare Fruit Growers. A memorial service for Gholston was held at the Arboretum in October.

**Brian Walton,** coordinator of UCSC's Predatory Bird Research Group, was quoted in the _Los Angeles Times_ in an article about the recovering California condor population.
