title: UC Santa Cruz Toxicologist Helps Reduce The Deadly Effects  Of Oil Spills On Underwater Life

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Oil tankers traveling through California waters  pose a grim threat to marine organisms, for which an accidental oil  spill could mean death. Most public attention focuses on slippery  surface oils that coat the fur of marine mammals and the feathers  of seabirds in a deadly black goo. But some little-noticed oil also  trickles down into the home of fish and shellfish, killing off these  less-visible ocean inhabitants.

UC Santa Cruz researcher Ronald Tjeerdema and his team study  the chemistry and effects of this sinking oil on fish, shellfish, and  their larvae. Larvae are especially critical, since they are both most  sensitive to toxins and also critical for the future of the species. An  entire generation of fish could be eliminated by the rarely mentioned  and hardly understood dissolved oils and their tiny droplets.  Tjeerdema's work will help oil-response crews choose the best way  to clean a spill, minimizing the impact on fragile underwater  organisms.

"We are basically putting together a Cliff's Notes for Oil-Spill  Response," says Tjeerdema, an associate professor of chemistry and  biochemistry and a board-certified toxicologist. His work could save  fish from dissolved oil clogging their gills or causing neurological  problems "that would make them behave as through they were drunk,"  he says. "What we want to do is compile a manual that we can give  to oil-spill responders."

Chevron recently gave Tjeerdema a $45,000 gift to support his  research. Michael Ammann, environmental specialist in ecology for  Chevron, selected Tjeerdema because "he and the group he  coordinates are on the cutting edge of applied research on the  toxicity of oil and dispersants." Ammann hopes this will be a long- term collaboration.

Tjeerdema's work focuses on twenty crude oils commonly  transported through California waters. In his lab at Granite Canyon,  south of Carmel, his research team studies the deadly effects of  both oils and oil-cleaning agents on two species of larval fish. His  team has found that different combinations of oils and detergents  have varying effects on larvae, but in general the detergents  themselves become less toxic when combined with oil.

Chemical sprays used to remove surface oils not only are toxic  to underwater organisms, but also help surface oil leach down into  the water. From the surface, the spill looks cleaned. However,  Tjeerdema says, "You don't hear about the stuff that dissolves in  water and kills fish and other marine animals."

Oil-response teams look at the major organisms in the area of  a spill, then pick a cleaning strategy best for that environment.  "They try to project the least impact on the most-sensitive  species," Tjeerdema says. Where marine mammals or birds are  important, they use a cleaning agent that quickly eliminates surface  oil, but where fish or shellfish are more critical, they use a spray  that will be less toxic and not allow oil to mix in the water.

The informational manual will list both the chemical  properties and toxicity for each of the different oil types  transported through California--mainly from Alaska and the Middle  East, plus California crude oil--as well as the toxicities generated  when different cleaning agents drop oil beneath the surface. With  Tjeerdema's information, oil-response crews can pick a cleaning  agent that is the least toxic with the type of oil spilled.

Every year, thousands of oil spills occur in California waters.  "A few gallons here, a few gallons there," says Tjeerdema, "but most  of these are mom-and-pop spills." Major spills occur only once every  three to five years. Any agency or individual who spills oil is  required to report it to the Coast Guard, which then calls in the  California Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response. Between  them- they decide on the best cleaning strategy.
