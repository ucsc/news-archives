SANTA CRUZ, CA--Ever wonder how to attract those beneficial insects-- otherwise known as "good bugs"--to your garden or farm? Entomologist Sean  Swezey of UC Santa Cruz will share his expertise during a free public  lecture and slide show on Saturday, February 7, from 7 to 9 P.M. His talk,  "'Good Bugs' for the Garden," will take place at the Patagonia store, 415  River Street, in Santa Cruz.

Gardeners and farmers like beneficial insects because they feed on  pests such as aphids, mites, white flies, and scale. Common beneficial  insects include lacewings, big-eyed bugs, and ladybird beetles, better known  as ladybugs, said Swezey, who will cover ways to attract and retain "good  bugs" in the garden or farm, as well as how to order them from insectaries.

"There are five or six families of flowers you should plant to attract  beneficial insects," said Swezey, who will discuss the different flower  varieties that are suited to Central Coast gardens.

Swezey will also give an update on his work developing organic  methods for growing cotton in the Central Valley. Swezey, who has  pioneered such techniques in partnership with cotton farmers over the past  several years, will describe how organic cotton is grown, what the  environmental benefits are of growing cotton organically, and why clothing  made from organic cotton is a feasible retail product today.

Swezey's talk is sponsored by the Friends of the UCSC Farm and Garden.  For more information, call (408) 459-3376.
