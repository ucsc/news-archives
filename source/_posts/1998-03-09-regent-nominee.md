title: UCLA Junior Named Student Regent Nominee
author: Terry Colvin, UC News Office

Max R. Espinoza, a political science and Chicana and Chicano studies double major at UCLA, has been nominated as the next student member of the UC Board of Regents.

Espinoza's nomination was approved by the Regents' Special Committee to Select a Student Regent during the board's February policy meeting in San Francisco. The full board will consider the appointment at its meeting on March 19 and 20.

Espinoza, a junior, was selected from among 56 student applicants representing UC's nine campuses. If appointed, Espinoza will serve a one-year term starting July 1 and succeed Kathryn T. McClymond, a graduate student in religious studies at UC Santa Barbara.

Espinoza would be the 24th student Regent since the position was established in 1975.

Assuming the Regents approve the appointment, Espinoza would be the student Regent-designate, participating fully in all deliberations but without a vote from March until July.

Espinoza has a strong record in campus and student involvement. He is currently serving as the student member on the UC Academic Senate Committee on Educational Policy and as the elected UCLA undergraduate academic affairs commissioner. He is serving as the chairperson of the UCLA Campus Retention Committee, which allocates over $300,000 a year to student-initiated and student-run retention projects of the Student Retention Center, one of the only totally student-run programs in the nation designed to support students and help them stay in school until graduation.

"I'm extremely honored to receive this nomination," Espinoza said. "I look forward to bringing my experience in representing student concerns and perspectives to the Board of Regents as it deliberates on the many important issues facing the University of California."
