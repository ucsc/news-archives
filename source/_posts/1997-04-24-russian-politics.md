SANTA CRUZ, CA--An eyewitness to many of the events that rocked Russia  during 1987-95, political scientist Michael Urban has captured much of the  drama of those years in his new book The Rebirth of Politics in Russia (Cambridge University Press, 1997). The  book covers the tumultuous years of Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership, the  breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the presidency of Boris Yeltsin.

The "rebirth of politics in Russia" has been marked by passion,  enthusiasm, outrage, and sometimes appalling naivet√©, said Urban, whose  comments are tempered by a sympathetic tone. "Russians are incredibly  ignorant about politics, and they've done it from scratch," he said. "There's  been very little to guide this process except a tremendous amount of energy  and a great deal of hatred of the people who ruined the country."

That anger was the key to Yeltsin's popularity, said Urban. "He said 'It  can be better. We've been held back. We can do better, and we need a leader  to take us there.' Yeltsin personified that feeling of hope," he said. "It was as  much religion as politics."

But if the first half of the story contains comic elements, said Urban,  the second half is a tragedy, as the very same people who'd represented the  return of political life began to betray the citizenry. "They created an  unmanageable, horrible government system, and their incapacities began  catching up with them," said Urban. With no grasp of the importance of  separation of power, Urban said, it is as if Russians replaced the czar with  the communist party, and the party with an all-powerful president. Each  time they created lots of problems.

Lines of authority are unclear, and the constitution is just "window  dressing," said Urban. The actual conduct of government is ordered by  presidential and governmental decrees, which are often inconsistent and  frequently ignored. As under czars and communists, Russian bureaucrats  tend to shift burdens to the populace, who are bearing the brunt of  unpredictable government behavior.

Urban blames Yeltsin for failing to create political institutions and  procedures that would end "the war of all against all." Instead, Yeltsin held  all the power, and the goal became "who can manipulate the czar," explained  Urban. "It's no way to run a country. It's very like czarism."

Now, with everyone certain that Yeltsin's health problems will prevent  him from ever running the country effectively again, there is a remote  chance that some rules will be established and lines of succession may be  drawn--if only because the country's elites fear General Alexander Lebed,  who almost certainly would win the next presidential election if no  procedural changes are made, said Urban.

"Right now the rules are a function of the players," said Urban, who  smiles as he recites Urban's Rule of Russian Politics: "The only reason two  politicians are not fighting each other is because they're each busy fighting  other people."

If the players don't reshape the system and make it more responsive to  voters, Urban said the possibility of revolt is real. "There is severe  suffering outside of Moscow," he said. "People are hungry. Starving to death.  Conditions are very bad."

The army, too, is hungry. Soldiers are not getting paid, and more than  500 officers in the Russian Army committed suicide last year, said Urban.  "The minister of defense said recently that he can't speak indefinitely about  control of Russia's nuclear arsenal," said Urban, raising the possibility of  civil war in Russia with nuclear weapons. "I feel apocalyptic, almost  alarmist even to mention it, but in all seriousness, it would be foolishly  optimistic to discount it as a possibility."
