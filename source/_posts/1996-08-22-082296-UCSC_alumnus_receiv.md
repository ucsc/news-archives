SANTA CRUZ, CA--Edward J. McCaughan, who earned his doctorate in  sociology from UCSC in 1995, has been awarded the prize for the  best dissertation given annually by a section of the American  Sociological Association.

McCaughan, who is an assistant professor of sociology at  Loyola University in New Orleans, was recognized by the Political  Economy of the World-System section of the association. He  received the award during the association's annual meeting, which  was held last week in New York City.

Titled "Global Change and Paradigm Crises: The Renovation of  Left Discourse in Cuba and Mexico," McCaughan's dissertation is  about the crisis facing leftists in Cuba and Mexico in the wake of the  collapse of the Soviet bloc and the rise of neoliberal politics in  Latin America. It will be published by Westview Press.

Walter Goldfrank, a professor of sociology at UCSC and  McCaughan's adviser, said the dissertation "breaks new ground  substantively and methodologically, representing a world-systems  analysis of political intellectuals in a time of world-historical  crisis." Goldfrank says it is the first attempt of which he is aware  "to analyze systematically how actors understand the impact of  global structural changes on their societies . . . and attempt to  reformulate their ideological and strategic positions in response."

McCaughan conducted lengthy interviews with 74 subjects in  Cuba and Mexico, which Goldfrank calls a "remarkable feat in field  research."

McCaughan earned his undergraduate degree in Latin American  studies from UCSC in 1972.
