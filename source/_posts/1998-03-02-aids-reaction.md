SANTA CRUZ, CA--The AIDS epidemic has spawned a range of organizational  responses, from radical groups like ACT-UP to the more staid San Francisco AIDS  Foundation. The origins and strategies of both groups are among those examined in the  new book Lessons from the Damned: Queers, Whores and Junkies Respond to AIDS by  sociologist Nancy Stoller of the University of California, Santa Cruz.

After more than 15 years of the global AIDS crisis, Stoller wanted to look at the  diversity of responses to the epidemic with an eye toward understanding what works for  whom and why. Lessons from the Damned looks at how the most disenfranchised groups- -the poor, people of color, drug users, gay men and lesbians, and women--have organized  to fight the epidemic.

"These groups have successfully marketed their marginality to have a real and  lasting impact on the epidemic," said Stoller, a scholar and AIDS activist with several years  experience working within AIDS organizations. "Whether they're made up of gay men or  former prostitutes or volunteers who knowingly break the law by distributing clean  needles, they have built effective social movements around AIDS."

Stoller's book focuses on five organizations:
* The San Francisco AIDS Foundation, established in 1982 to provide education  and social services; run primarily by white gay men, it grew from a grassroots volunteer  group to a multimillion-dollar-a-year bureaucracy.
* The California Prevention Education Project (Cal-PEP), a San Francisco-based  organization of ex-prostitutes that does outreach to prostitutes and other members of the  "street community" and contends with "permanent tension between acceptability and  stigma."
* New York City ACT-UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power), which uses direct  action in its negotiations with government leaders and large corporations and to call  attention to the crisis; membership is primarily well educated, white, and gay.
* Prevention Point, a large decentralized group of volunteers who distribute clean  needles to drug users in San Francisco.
* The Asian AIDS Task Force, and its organizational descendants, established in  1986 to assess and improve services needed by Asians in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Stoller found that organizational structure and culture have a greater impact on who  is served--and how well--than do public health theories or stated organizational goals.  "There are a lot of different models that work. Some are more bureaucratic than others, but  clearly no one model is the best or right model," said Stoller, whose research included  extensive interviews with leaders and members of AIDS organizations. "What makes the  biggest difference in terms of the programs and interventions adopted by each group are the  cultural backgrounds of the most powerful people in the organization, which clearly  affected the types of organizations they built."

Sometimes, Stoller found, the quality and/or success of a group's effort is affected  by the choices made by its leaders, who may at times be unaware of their cultural biases or  assumptions. Stoller compares posters and brochures produced by various organizations  for different groups--gays, straights, and people of color--and points out the relative  strengths and weaknesses of materials that target different populations. For example, she  concludes that ACT UP's posters for white gay men are graphically superior to the text- laden posters they've produced for women and people of color.

Those types of differences reflect the backgrounds of decision makers, said Stoller.  "Their rhetoric is different from their programmatic expressions," she said. "Consistently,  the big decisions are based on people's intuitive understandings of their own community.  Sometimes that works and other times it results in an unintentionally racist or sexist  product."

Stoller concludes that leaders of organizations need to be conscious of the role that  class, ethnicity, and gender play in their decision making, and she offers guidelines for  dealing with diversity and conflict among those on the front lines of the epidemic.

"Ultimately, we need to develop coalitions and networks of AIDS organizations,"  said Stoller. "No one group can do it all. In fact, my work underscores the contributions  made by these diverse organizations. We need to be sure that groups are sharing their  strengths and recognizing their weaknesses."

Biographical information about Nancy Stoller: Stoller, a professor in the Community Studies Department at UCSC, worked with the SF  AIDS Foundation as the coordinator of materials development and distribution and was the  founder and director of the Women's Program during 1985-87. She helped develop the  Women's AIDS Network, a national group of professionals and activists engaged in  political and resource development around AIDS and is coauthor of Women Resisting  AIDS: Feminist Strategies of Empowerment.
