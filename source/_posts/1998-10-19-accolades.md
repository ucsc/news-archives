**Zhiwu Zhu,** an assistant professor of biology, has received a James A. Shannon Director's Award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Shannon Award is intended to provide support to meritorious research grant applications that did not receive full funding through the regular NIH grant program. The award provides a total of $100,000 in research funding for a period of 24 months. Zhu's research focuses on the biochemistry and molecular biology of metal ions, such as copper, which can trigger disease at abnormal levels.

Three earth sciences graduate students--**Sue Bilek, Renate Hartog,** and **Sara Russell**\--attended a two-week workshop on earthquakes and earth structure seismology held in Trieste, Italy, Sept. 28 - Oct 9. The United States was provided with funds for eight full support packages for graduate students to attend this international workshop. A competitive national search resulted in three of the eight support grants going to UCSC graduate students. The three UCSC students were joined by a few colleagues from Princeton, MIT, Harvard, and Washington University.
