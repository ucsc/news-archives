## UC Santa Cruz Faculty Member Examines Civil War April 13

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Bruce Levine, professor of history at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will present a talk, titled "An Emancipation Proclamation for the Confederacy," on Thursday, April 13, from 7 to 8 p.m. at the Museum of Art and History at the McPherson Center, 705 Front St., Santa Cruz. The talk is a part of the Humanities Lecture Series, sponsored jointly by UCSC's Humanities Division and the Museum of Art and History. The talk is free and open to the public. A reception follows.

Levine has written and taught on a wide range of historical subjects, but his main interests are the U.S.'s Civil War era and the trans-Atlantic "age of revolutions." He is the author of four books: Half Slave and Half Free: The Roots of the Civil War (1992); The Spirit of 1848: German Immigrants, Labor Conflict, and the Coming of the Civil War (1992); Who Built America, Volume One (1989) (principal author); and Who Built America, Volume Two (1992) (contributing author). Previous to coming to UCSC in 1997, Levine was a professor of history at the University of Cincinnati for 11 years and, before that, worked as director of research and writing for the American Social History Project at the City University of New York's Graduate Center.
