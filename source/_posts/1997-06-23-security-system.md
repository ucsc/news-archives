Re: New Security Alarms Policy **

New policies are now in effect which regulate campus security alarms and give the UCSC police chief the authority to review all requests for new security alarms and modifications to existing alarms.

In summary, after receiving Police Department authorization, the individual unit is responsible for:
* Arranging any necessary telephone line wiring with CATS
* Arranging with Physical Plant to coordinate the purchase, installation, and inspection of any alarm that utilizes more than 60 volts for a power source, or arrange with Purchasing for the installation of a new system that requires less than 60 volts
* Having a sign installed that warns that the area is alarmed
* Testing and maintaining the alarm system
Beginning July 1, 1997, two new fees will be implemented (both have been reviewed and approved by the campus recharge committee):

**FALSE ALARMS**

A false alarm is defined as an alarm which is accidentally activated by an authorized user of an alarmed area. (Alarm malfunctions will not be included in this false alarm count.) A maximum of three false alarms per 90-day period will be permitted without penalty. After that, the following fees will apply:
* Fourth false alarm: $25   
* Fifth false alarm: $50   
* Sixth & subsequent: $100

**MONITORING**

Security alarms which are monitored by the UCSC Dispatch Center will be charged $15 per month. Those alarms which are monitored by a private vendor will not pay a UCSC monitoring fee, but will instead be responsible for the private vendor fee.

The Police Department does not charge to survey your area or to provide information about crime prevention strategies.
