In a review of best-selling sociology books, **Bill Domhoff** of sociology and psychology emerged as one of only two authors with four books on the list. The list, which appears in the March issue of the journal _Contemporary Sociology,_ includes 53 books published since World War II that had sold more than 50,000 copies through 1995. Domhoff's book _Who Rules America?,_ published by Prentice Hall in 1967, holds the No. 12 spot on the list, having sold between 200,000 and 299,000 copies. His other books on the list were _Higher Circles, Who Rules America Now?,_ and _Powers That Be._

Professor of music **Leta Miller** was asked to write on Lou Harrison for the Lincoln Center playbill, which covers a series of concerts at the center April 26-28 in celebration of the composer's 80th birthday. Miller wrote the biographical sketch of Harrison as well as program notes. The playbill also includes a section on instruments and instrumentation excerpted from a book on Harrison, coauthored by Miller and professor of music **Fredric Lieberman,** which will be published soon by Oxford University Press.
