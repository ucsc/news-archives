Research by psychology's **Jean Fox Tree** and her colleague **Josef Schrock** was featured in _Jane_ magazine.

**Manuel Pastor** of Latin American and Latino studies was quoted in a _Wired News_ story about the need for a shift in Silicon Valley hiring practices to produce greater racial diversification. The story was about Jesse Jackson's call for greater diversity on the boards of high-tech companies.

Economist **Menzie Chinn** was part of a recent panel discussion about Japan's economic woes on WBEZ, the public radio station in Chicago. He and panelists from Loyola University and University of Chicago's business school discussed near-zero interest rates in Japan, the role of monetary policy in reviving the economy, and what lessons there are for the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. The show, _Odyssey,_ is produced by UCSC alumnus Joshua Andrews.
