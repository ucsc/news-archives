SANTA CRUZ, CA--Dartmouth College professor James Tatum will be  the featured speaker for the Carl M. Deppe Memorial Lecture,  presented annually for the past eight years at the University of  California, Santa Cruz. His talk and slide show, "Homeric Maya Lin,"  takes place on Friday, April 28, at 4 p.m. in the Cowell College  Provost's House. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is  designed for general audiences.

Tatum will discuss the ways in which cultures memorialize  wars and those who die in them, looking specifically at the Vietnam  Memorial in Washington, D.C., designed by artist Maya Lin, and the  works of Homer, the ancient Greek poet best known for his epic  poems on the Trojan War.

Tatum holds the distinguished post of Aaron Lawrence  Professor of Classics at Dartmouth. He is currently writing a book  on the topic of war memorials and memorialization of the dead. His  research has taken him to Vietnam, where he has visited  battlefields and memorials of the Vietnam War.

The annual lectures are presented in memory of a UCSC student  who was majoring in classics at the time he died. A reception will  follow the talk. For more information, call (408) 459-2487.
