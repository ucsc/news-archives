**What's Fall Quarter Without A Convocation?**

UCSC students, faculty, and staff are about to find out. Due to construction taking place outside the Upper Quarry, UCSC won't host a convocation this fall to usher in the academic year. Instead, all new and returning undergraduate students are invited to meet Chancellor Greenwood at a dessert reception at University House on Sunday, September 27. Graduate students are invited to a similar gathering on Monday, September 28.

Staff and faculty will welcome back the year with an annual barbecue lunch for staff on Monday, October 12, and a "strolling dinner" for faculty on Wednesday, October 28. (See future issues of _Currents_ for details.)

UCSC traditionally holds its annual convocation in the Upper Quarry, which is closed due to construction of the new Bay Tree Bookstore and Graduate Commons. The quarry is expected to be reopened and the project completed by spring 2000.

No other campus venue is considered large enough to hold the convocation, which has drawn more than 1,000 members of the campus community to the quarry each year.
