![\[Photo of Chancellor Greenwood and students making outreach calls\]][1] More than 30 volunteers helped Chancellor Greenwood kick off an admissions phonathon last week. Callers plan to reach all of the 2,400 underrepresented students who were admitted to UCSC for next fall before the phonathon ends on Thursday, March 19.

Students, members of the faculty and staff, and even the chancellor helped kick off an admissions phonathon on Monday, March 9. The 32 volunteer callers spoke to more than 500 prospective students during the 5-9 p.m. calling session at Hahn Student Services. Monday's session was one of ten scheduled to take place during the phonathon, which ends Thursday, March 19\.

Organizers hope that during that time volunteers can reach all the underrepresented students who have applied and been accepted to UCSC for fall 1998--a total of about 2,400 students. More than 100 members of the campus community have volunteered to make the calls.

"We are reaching out to underrepresented students to encourage them to come to the Banana Slug Spring Fair (UCSC's open house on April 18) and see if we can answer any questions about the campus and its programs," said J. Michael Thompson, UCSC's associate vice chancellor for enrollment management and director of admissions.

While the phonathon is directed toward underrepresented students, the majority of efforts sponsored by the Admissions Office this winter and spring are aimed toward encouraging all students accepted for fall 1998 to enroll at UCSC.

These programs, dubbed "yield" efforts, include mailing personalized letters to admitted students from UCSC's deans, academic departments, and student groups; offering an expanded campus-tour schedule, with six tours a day; and sponsoring "Scholars Day" for academically outstanding students.

Admissions counselors also travel to a number of high schools during this time, answering questions for students and making contacts. Community college counselors are invited to a two-day institute designed to provide them with information they need to effectively advise students who are planning to transfer to the UC or California State University systems.

"We want prospective students to have the best information possible about the campus, its academic programs, and the living and learning environment for students here," Thompson said.

Yield efforts will continue to become increasingly important for the campus, according to Thompson. For many years, UCSC has accepted all students who apply to the campus and are eligible for admission to the University of California. Starting with the admissions process for fall 1999, UCSC will no longer have room to accept all students who apply and are eligible.

As UCSC admits its fall 1999 class, it will therefore be admitting a larger proportion of students that are likely to have been admitted at other UC campuses, Thompson explains. "It will be a more competitive market for those students," he said.

Thompson said he's happy to see such a broad base of support on campus for efforts to "yield" prospective students. "The selfless dedication of faculty, staff, and students to on-campus events and other activities is a testament to their dedication to the institution and its students," he said.

The Admissions Office will start seeing the results of this year's "yield" efforts in early May, when Statements of Intent to Register (SIR) are due from students hoping to attend UCSC as freshmen. Transfer student SIRs are due June 1.

Volunteers are still needed to staff phonathon telephones. To volunteer, call Patricia Duran at (408) 459-2678.
