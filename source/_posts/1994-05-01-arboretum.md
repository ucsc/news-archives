**"Horticulture II" And A New Gift Shop, "Norrie's," Promise To Cultivate Further Public Activities At Ucsc's Unique Site**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Visitors to the famed Arboretum at the University  of California, Santa Cruz, will be delighted by what has sprouted  there since October among the fragrant and colorful plants. Two new  buildings, funded entirely by private donations, will greatly enhance  the Arboretum's programs for people both on and off campus.

The new buildings are a 2,000-square-foot expansion to the  Horticulture Building and a gift shop, "Norrie's," near the main  entrance. Supporters of the Arboretum and the university community  dedicated the buildings in ceremonies on April 30.

"These are marvelous additions to the Arboretum," says Lorna  Clark, president of the Arboretum Associates, a campus support  group that raises funds and sponsors events. "They will open many  new opportunities for us and will allow us to interact with the  public in ways we have not done in the past."

The major expansion, called "Horticulture II," features a large  multipurpose room for meetings, university classes, and public  programs such as lectures and slide shows. An adjacent room houses  the "Jean and Bill Lane Library"--named for former Sunset magazine  publisher Ambassador L. W. "Bill" Lane, Jr., and Mrs. Jean Lane of  Portola Valley, who donated $50,000 to the project. The building  also contains two rest rooms and a kitchen area. An attractive arbor  and patio connect Horticulture II to its smaller predecessor,  Horticulture I.

The gift shop, named for the late daughter of donor Elspeth  Bobbs, opens to the public on May 1 with a weeklong series of  special events, concluding with a prize drawing on May 8. It carries  plants, dried-flower arrangements, books, wood carvings, ceramics,  paintings, and other items related to horticulture and the outdoors.  Proceeds will help the Arboretum become an independent campus  unit within five years.

Other major donors to the building projects included Thelma  Hoffman and Elise Hoffman, Barbara Shields, and the late Albert  Smith.

The UCSC Arboretum resides on 40 acres of sunny and gently  sloping land on the UCSC campus. It holds what many regard as the  foremost collections of Australian and South African plants outside  of those countries. Many of these Southern Hemisphere species are  not otherwise available for study in American botanical gardens and  arboreta. Arboretum workers also focus on New Zealand plants,  plants from around the Pacific Rim, and species native to California.  A tranquil eucalyptus grove contains about 60 different types of  eucalpytus trees.

In importing and cultivating the Arboretum's species, which  now number more than 6,000, workers have emphasized both beauty  and the important qualities of drought tolerance and pest resistance.  Arboretum staff and volunteers grow many varieties of such plants  and distribute them to nurseries and the public throughout central  California and the state.

Visitors to the Arboretum can guide themselves around the  grounds or can find help from volunteer docents on Wednesday,  Saturday, and Sunday afternoons. In addition to the many striking  flowers, shrubs, and trees, visitors particularly enjoy the  hummingbirds and butterflies that the Arboretum attracts in droves.

UCSC professor Ray Collett has directed the Arboretum since  its inception when the campus opened in 1965. Other current staff  members include longtime manager Brett Hall, Harry O. Warren  Curator Tom Sauceda, nursery manager Helen Englesberg, succulents  manager Stephen McCabe, and horticulturalist Melinda Johnson.

The Arboretum Associates received major assistance in  completing the building projects from the UCSC Foundation, a  nonprofit public benefit corporation that promotes understanding of  UCSC and encourages support for campus programs. According to  Daniel Aldrich, assistant chancellor for University Advancement, the  buildings cost $405,000--well below the cost of constructing them  through normal university channels. To speed the process and save  money, the UCSC Foundation leased the land and existing facility  from the UC Regents, and now will lease the new buildings back to  the Regents for twenty years. Construction took less than six  months and benefited from the support of area contractors, vendors,  and unions.

Aldrich credits the many donors, the strong partnership  between the Arboretum Associates and the UCSC Foundation, and the  commitment of Chancellor Karl S. Pister for the project's success.  Within the Foundation, president John Halliday, past president Anne  Levin, and chair of the capital projects committee Jack Baskin were  instrumental. Says Aldrich: "All of these many contributions came  together to enable this project to take place."
