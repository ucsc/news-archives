title: Research And Public Consultation Are Key To Destroying Chemical Weapons, Says Team Of Scientists

ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, MD--Countries trying to destroy their  stockpiles of chemical weapons should carry out additional basic  research and carefully inform the public about the pros and cons of  various destruction methods, according to an international task  force of civilian and military researchers.

In a new report, the task force identified eight scientific  problems that hinder the speedy eradication of huge reserves of  "mustard," nerve toxins, and other inhumane chemical relics of war.  But gaps in scientific knowledge are only part of the dilemma. Just  as damaging, the report states, is fierce opposition from citizens  near storage sites--protests that are complicated by ignorance  about the risks of moving and destroying chemical warfare agents.

"Public worries have gone beyond the seriousness of the  problem," says Joseph Bunnett, chairman of the task force and  professor emeritus of chemistry at the University of California,  Santa Cruz. "It was a mistake for military authorities not to consult  with the public and take them into confidence when they decided  more than ten years ago that incinerating these weapons was the  best way to destroy them."

Fourteen chemists and military experts on the task force,  representing nine countries, have studied scientific aspects of the  destruction of chemical weapons since 1991. The group works under  the auspices of the International Union of Pure and Applied  Chemistry (IUPAC). In early September, the scientists met in Rome  to discuss and approve their latest recommendations. Bunnett  summarized the report today (November 17) at the U.S. Army's  Scientific Conference on Chemical and Biological Defense Research.

Worldwide agreement that chemical weapons must be  destroyed has pushed technological issues to the forefront, the  report states. The issues are not trivial. Although chemists and  engineers have learned much about the properties of chemical  warfare agents and ways to destroy them, both technological  uncertainties and public outrage have ground the process to a virtual  standstill. As a result, enormous stockpiles still exist--most  notably the 30,000 tons stored at eight military bases in the  continental U.S. and an even larger amount in the former Soviet  Union.

Further basic research in several areas would do much to break  the deadlock, the task force advises. For example, citizens worry  that an accident or incomplete burning might release small amounts  of chemical warfare agents into the environment near their homes.  Natural processes, such as interactions with sunlight, water,  organisms in the soil, or reactive compounds in the air, are likely to  degrade the agents quite rapidly. Laboratory research could define  those degradation rates and possibly offer evidence that minor leaks  would not pose serious health threats.

Research also could lead to better ways of detecting leaks or  spills both inside and outside destruction facilities, the report  states. "Technology exists to monitor for leaks along natural-gas  pipelines," says Bunnett. "In principle, it is possible to make similar  devices to detect trace amounts of a chemical warfare agent and  identify it immediately. This would help ease the concerns of  neighbors."

Other recommendations of the task force include:
* Develop techniques to determine the types of agents in old  weapons found in lakes and seas or dug up on battlefields or old  military posts from World War I and II.
* Refine knowledge of the chemistry of "mustard," an agent  that often forms dangerous gels or crusty solids in old containers.
* Develop ways to detect, with great accuracy, whether tiny  amounts of an agent survive a destruction process.
* Investigate whether chemical brines that result from  burning or neutralizing an agent might safely be discharged into the  ocean.

Bunnett notes that the U.S. Army largely stopped its research  program on how to destroy chemical warfare agents in 1982, when it  concluded that incinerating the agents and their containers was the  best approach. Recently, reports from the National Research Council- -to which Bunnett contributed--have noted that other approaches  also may be feasible, such as chemically neutralizing the agents. In  response, some research has resumed, both within the Army and by  civilian scientists. The IUPAC task force urges a more concerted  effort. "There is still time to do such research," Bunnett says. "It is  insurance against future trouble, and it is a rock-bottom necessity."

Meanwhile, estimated costs for the destruction program  continue to soar--over $8 billion in the U.S. alone--and public  disapproval of incineration shows few signs of abating. The task  force recommends that chemists themselves can help address the  latter problem by reaching out to media and the lay public. Bunnett,  for example, has spoken to citizens near storage sites in Alabama  and Oregon and is writing an article for a popular magazine in  Russia.
