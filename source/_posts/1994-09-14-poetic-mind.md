SANTA CRUZ, CA--When John Lennon proclaimed in 1964 that the  Beatles had become more popular than Jesus Christ, he was engaging  in the age-old practice of using irony to make a social statement.

Like Lennon, people rely on figurative speech all the time to  help convey their messages. When a coworker says her boss's request  made her "flip her lid," her use of an idiom is easily understood as a  description of anger. When someone says his relationship is "at a  crossroads" or "going downhill," he is using a familiar metaphor to  describe the situation. Indeed, figures of speech are so common that  one study predicts that each individual will utter 25 million  metaphors during a given 60-year life span.

Why is figurative speech so prevalent, and why do we so often  rely on irony, sarcasm, metaphor, slang, and other forms of  figurative speech to help us communicate? According to Raymond W.  Gibbs, Jr., a psychology professor at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, figurative speech comes naturally because it parallels  the nonliteral way we experience much of our lives. "People assume  that we think literally, so they see figurative speech as a departure  from that," says Gibbs. "I disagree. I think figurative speech reflects  how we actually experience much of our lives. We talk about life and  love as being like a journey because that's how it feels. It is like a  journey."

A leading researcher in the field of psycholinguistics, Gibbs  has stirred controversy with his views, which he presents in his  new book, The Poetics of Mind (Cambridge, England: Cambridge  University Press, 1994). For decades, scholars have tended to view  figurative language as a departure from literal thought--a poetic  form of communication that tends to hide or even distort the real  meaning of a message. On the contrary, says Gibbs, figurative speech  reveals the poetic structure of the mind. "We think of poets as  special, unique individuals with rare abilities to talk about things  like love," says Gibbs. "In fact, there's a relatively small number of  metaphors that are used to describe love, and poets elaborate on the  same basic metaphors that everyone uses."

Consider the language used to talk about love: "falling in love,"  "getting dumped," "drunk with love," "sustained by love," "starved for  affection." "We have a very limited number of ways to talk about  love--as a journey, heat, magic, or a plant to be cultivated and  nurtured," says Gibbs. "Similarly, we talk about anger in terms of  'blowing your stack,' 'hitting the ceiling,' and 'getting hot under the  collar.' Those are all based on the concept that anger is heated fluid  in a container. It's almost impossible to think of love or anger  without metaphor because we have no literal concept of them."

Gibbs believes people are particularly inclined to rely on  metaphors to describe things that are difficult to grasp, such as  emotions or abstract ideas, and that metaphoric themes emerge in  part because physical sensations are associated with emotions, such  as the hot flush of anger. "The fact is that metaphor is so pervasive,  we're blind to it," says Gibbs. "Even when people don't think they're  doing it, they're doing it. Everybody's doing it. You can't help but do  it."

In his book, Gibbs draws on sources as diverse as Plato and  Sylvia Plath, rock star Annie Lennox and Supreme Court decisions. He  quotes a midwestern factory worker describing his view of life:

Well to me, you gotta keep forward. You don't wanna make no  turns, 'cause if you make a turn you're gonna be off course. And  you're not gonna go any further. So you just stay on a straight line.  Sure, you're gonna run into some obstacles. But it's just temporary.  There's gonna be some obstacles but you gotta jump back on track.

Figurative language appears to make perfect sense to  listeners. Gibbs, whose vast empirical work includes experiments to  measure how long it takes people to understand metaphor and  sarcasm, has found that in many cases people don't take any longer  to understand figurative speech. Young children also appear to grasp  and use figurative speech at an early age, although Gibbs notes that  more research in that area is needed. Similarly, the small amount of  cross-cultural research that has been done on figurative speech  indicates that some metaphors are shared by different cultures.

Gibbs maintains that many concepts have come to be regarded  as objective truth despite the fact that they are largely the products  of figurative thought. "When scientists develop computerized models  of how the mind works, they believe that's actually how the mind  works, when in fact it's a model of their ideas," explains Gibbs.  "We've lost sight of the role of figurative thought, which provides  much of the foundation for thought, reason, and imagination."

A dedicated empirical scientist himself, Gibbs spent five  years writing his book, frequently setting it aside to conduct his  own experiments. "Cognitive science has been seriously limited by  the dominance of the traditional view that thought and language are  inherently literal," says Gibbs. "I describe my work to graduate  students by saying that for years cognitive scientists have been  acting like drunks looking for their car keys only under the light of  the lamppost. I'm saying let's crawl out into the darkness and see  what's out there."
