In my dreams the impossible is not a Jewish concept.

\--Elie Wiesel from All Rivers Run to the Sea

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Nobel Peace Prize-winning author and Holocaust  survivor Elie Wiesel will present a talk titled "An Evening with Elie  Wiesel" on Tuesday, May 7, at 7:30 p.m. in the Santa Cruz Civic  Auditorium. The talk, one of only four West Coast appearances, is  presented by the Neufeld-Levin Holocaust Lecture Series of  Stevenson College at UC Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz Hillel Foundation,  UCSC Arts & Lectures, and Metro Newspapers.

In his recent memoir, All Rivers Run to the Sea, Wiesel recalls  the time his mother took him to seek the blessing of the visiting  Rabbi Israel of Wizhnitz. The Rabbi spoke alone with the eight-year- old Wiesel for a long time before sending him out so that he might  speak alone with Wiesel's mother. Wiesel remembers his mother  came out sobbing from her visit with the Rabbi. The distraught boy  was sure the Rabbi had discovered terrible evil in him and begged for  weeks to learn from his mother what had been said. His mother never  told him, but some 25 years later a cousin revealed the Rabbi's  words. According to Wiesel's cousin, the Rabbi had said, "Sarah,  know that your son will become a gadol b'Israel, a great man in  Israel, but neither you nor I will live to see the day. That's why I am  telling you now."

Wiesel's mother, father, and younger sister all died in the  Holocaust. Wiesel, who survived along with his two older sisters,  more than fulfilled the Rabbi's prophecy. The Andrew W. Mellon  Professor in the Humanities and a University Professor at Boston  University, Wiesel is the author of more than 35 books, holds  honorary degrees from more than 75 colleges and universities in the  U.S. and abroad, and is the recipient of numerous awards, including  the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, the  Medal of Liberty Award, the rank of Grand Officer in the French  Legion of Honor, and in 1986, the Nobel Peace Prize.

Born in 1928 in Sighet, Romania, Wiesel was transported to  Auschwitz with his family when he was fifteen years old. His  mother and youngest sister died there. He and his father were later  transported to Buchenwald where Wiesel remained until the war  ended. After the war he studied at the Sorbonne in Paris and began  his career in journalism.

Wiesel has dedicated his life to peace and human rights. In  1986 he and his wife, Marion, founded the Elie Wiesel Foundation for  Humanity, and in 1993 Wiesel became the founding president of the  Universal Academy of Cultures in Paris. He was appointed chairman  of the President's Commission on the Holocaust in 1978 by President  Jimmy Carter and is founding chairman of the United States  Holocaust Memorial Council.

Wiesel is a devoted supporter of Israel and has worked to  improve the conditions of Soviet Jews, Nicaragua's Miskito Indians,  Argentina's "disappeared," Cambodian refugees, the Kurds, South  African apartheid victims, famine victims in Africa, and war  victims in the former Yugoslavia.

He has written a broad-ranging body of works, from his first  book, Night, an account of his time in Nazi concentration camps, to  novels, plays, biblical writings, and even a haggadah (the book used  in the Passover seder). Among the awards his works have won are  the Prix MÃ©dicis for A Beggar in Jerusalem, the Prix Livre Inter for  The Testament, and the Grand Prize for Literature from the City of  Paris for The Fifth Son. His most recent work, All Rivers Run to the  Sea, was released in the U.S. in 1995.
