SANTA CRUZ, CA--If you're interested in alternative agriculture and  enjoy working with people, now is the time to consider volunteering  as a docent at the 25-acre Farm at the University of California,  Santa Cruz. Applications are available now for the five-week docent  training program, which begins March 14.

During the training, docents will learn about organic farming  and gardening methods, issues in sustainable agriculture, and the  basic principles of leading interpretive tours. After the training,  docents will participate in a range of activities that include tours  and public education programs, plantings, and harvests.

The initial training consists of five six-hour sessions on  Thursday afternoons from noon to 6 p.m. March 14 through April 11.  Participants will learn how to lead tours for a range of visitors-- from children to seniors and from novices to international scholars.  The Farm will introduce a monthly tour in Spanish, so bilingual  volunteers are needed, too. A $30 fee covers the cost of materials, a  docent manual, and a Farm and Garden T-shirt.

After completing the training, docents must volunteer at least  six hours per month and attend monthly educational meetings.

Class size is limited, so advance registration is recommended.  Applications and other materials are available from Melanie Mintz at  the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, UCSC,  Santa Cruz, CA 95064, or by calling (408) 459-3248.
