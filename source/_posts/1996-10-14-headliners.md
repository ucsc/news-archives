It seems that everyone is interested in consciousness these days, prompted in part by the release last spring of philosopher **David Chalmers's** book, _The Conscious Mind._ The book, which instigated lively debate in mainstream newspapers and scientific magazines, continues to draw coverage in the U.S. and abroad, notably, in the _Economist_, the _Times Literary Supplement,_ the _London Times, New Scientist,_ the _L.A. Times,_ "Lateline" on Australian TV, and NPR's "All Things Considered."   

_Science_ printed a special news section on the latest theories about how new species form, and our own evolutionary biologist, **Bill Rice,** was prominent in two of the articles. One story referred to Rice's now-famous research on "sexually antagonistic coevolution" among fruit flies, which he published earlier this year.   

The _San Francisco Chronicle_ routinely relies upon UCSC's astronomers and astrophysicists to comment on news about the universe. The latest examples: **Doug Lin** provided healthy skepticism on a theory that the early Earth was like today's Jupiter, and **Stan Woosley** put into perspective the most energetic bursts of gamma rays yet detected. On the national astronomy scene, _Science News _cited research by **Sandy Faber** and postdoc **James Lowenthal** on extremely distant galaxies.  

**George Von der Muhll** of politics received a Fulbright award, an achievement that was noted in the _Sentinel_. 

**Fred Siff** of Communications and Technology Services (CATS) spoke to KSCO's Michelle Chambliss in September about a partnership between UCSC and the Santa Cruz and Monterey county offices of education. CATS is helping the offices develop a regional computer network for K-12 schools. The _Sentinel_ and KSBW-TV also reported on the story.

Poet **Nate Mackey** was the subject of a two-page spread in the _Chronicle of Higher Education._   

Professor of education **Laurie Edwards's** Lego/Logo workshop at Barrios Unidos made the "School Bell" column in the _Sentinel_, which also covered a series of videotapes produced by **Jon Silver** in conjunction with the National Center for Research on Cultural Diversity and Second Language Learning. The _Aptos Times _also covered the videos. . . . Also in education news, a professional development institute for teachers held at **Life Lab** was covered by KSBW-TV and the _Watsonville Register-Pajaronian_.

Marine sciences grad student **Michelle Paddack,** who studies the effects of nearshore ecological preserves on populations of rockfish, hit the headlines recently in a _Monterey County Herald_ story about Monterey Bay fisheries. That article also appeared in two large papers in the East Bay: the _Oakland Tribune_ and the _Contra Costa Times_.

Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Program scholarship recipients **Lia Cracraft**, **Leah Hunt**, **I Crow X**, and **Tina Bryson** have been profiled in regional papers, including the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_, the _Monterey County Herald_, and the _Morgan Hill Times_.

**Special Collections** had its day in the sun when the _College and Research Library News_ featured a Kenneth Patchen painted poem on the cover, one selected from our library's extensive Kenneth Patchen collection.
