SANTA CRUZ, CA--Scholars from around the country will gather at  the University of California, Santa Cruz, to discuss the life and work  of conservationist and former UCSC faculty member Grant McConnell  at a memorial colloquium scheduled for 3 p.m. on Friday, February  17, in the Merrill College Baobab Lounge.

McConnell, who died in his Bonny Doon home in 1993 at the age  of 78, was a professor of politics at UCSC from 1969 until his  retirement in 1980. He is known for his visionary work in the field  of environmental politics and is considered a seminal figure in the  study of American political development. An ardent conservationist,  McConnell played a key role in the effort to establish the North  Cascades National Park in Washington State. He was instrumental in  founding UCSC's environmental studies program and also helped  establish College Eight at UCSC. Among his books are The Modern  Presidency, Steel and the Presidency, and Private Power and  American Democracy, now considered a classic. McConnell came to  UCSC from the University of Chicago, where he was chair of the  Political Science Department.

The colloquium will feature a keynote talk titled "The Decline  of McConnell's Democracy," presented by Theodore Lowi, a former  president of the American Political Science Association and  currently the John L. Senior Professor of American Institutions at  Cornell University. Following will be a roundtable discussion, titled  "Memories of McConnell," featuring Robert Hawkinson, a professor of  politics and dean of the college at Willamette University; Karen  Orren, a professor of political science at UCLA; and Michael Rogin, a  professor of political science at UC Berkeley.

The talk is sponsored by the Board of Studies in Politics at  UCSC. A reception follows. For more information, call (408) 459- 2505.
