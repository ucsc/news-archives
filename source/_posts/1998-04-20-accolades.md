**Frank Talamantes,** professor of biology, has received a 1997 Distinguished Scientist Award from the national Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS). The awards, presented for the first time this year, are given to outstanding scientists and leaders in education who have brought distinction to the scientific community.

The California Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CAMP) has also honored Talamantes by establishing the Frank Talamantes Science Prize at UCSC. The prize, which carries a monetary award of $5,000, will be awarded annually to a biological sciences major pursuing research in preparation for graduate education. The resolution announcing the prize recognizes and commends Talamantes for "his outstanding contribution to science education and to improving the quality of undergraduate education for Chicano/Latino and Native American students in science."
