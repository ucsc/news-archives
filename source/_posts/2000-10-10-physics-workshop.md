SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will present a physics workshop for high school teachers on Saturday, October 28. The workshop, which is free and open to all teachers, will take place from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Room 1, Thimann Lecture Hall, on the UCSC campus.

The workshop will give teachers a new perspective on modern physics and help them develop an up-to-date curriculum for high school physics. It will feature science presentations by UCSC physics faculty, a report on SCIPP's 2000 Research Experience for Teachers program, and an interactive session on advancing the physics curriculum. The workshop is hosted by SCIPP and UCSC physics faculty.

Talks by leading theorists and experimental researchers in physics will cover a range of topics. Presentations will include talks by:
* Douglas Lin, Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics
