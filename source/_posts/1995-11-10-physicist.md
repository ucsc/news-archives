SANTA CRUZ, CA--Joel Primack, a professor of physics at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, has been elected a fellow of the  American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the  world's largest federation of scientists.

The AAAS Council elevates members to the rank of fellow to  recognize distinguished efforts toward advancing science or its  applications. The council cited Primack for his "pioneering efforts in  the establishment of the AAAS Congressional Science Fellows  Program and for dedication to expanding the use of science in policy  making throughout government." The citation acknowledges  Primack's career-long concern with the impacts that science has  upon society, and the roles scientists can and should play in shaping  those influences.

Primack was a key figure in creating the Congressional  Science Fellows Program, which began in 1973. The program brings  25 to 30 young scientists and engineers to Washington, D.C., each  year to work for members of Congress and congressional science  committees. Many of the fellows remain to pursue full-time careers  in science policy. As a result, lawmaking and budgetary decisions  are now more informed by accurate scientific and technical input.

Primack also has contributed to the National Science  Foundation's Science for Citizens program, the AAAS Clearinghouse  on Science and Human Rights, and the American Physical Society's  program of studies on issues of social policy. With Princeton  physicist Frank von Hippel, he wrote the book Advice and Dissent:  Scientists in the Political Arena, which received the 1977 American  Physical Society Forum on Physics and Society Award. He also has  written extensively on issues of energy policy, arms control, and  protection of the space environment.

Primack earned an A.B. from Princeton University and a Ph.D.  from Stanford University, both in physics. He joined the UCSC  faculty in 1973. His research focuses on the developing field of  cosmology and particle astrophysics, in which scientists make  models of how the universe has evolved based upon theories and  observations of the kinds of matter it contains.

This year, the AAAS Council elected 273 fellows, including 26  researchers at the University of California. Each new fellow will  receive a certificate and rosette in February at a meeting of the  AAAS in Baltimore.
