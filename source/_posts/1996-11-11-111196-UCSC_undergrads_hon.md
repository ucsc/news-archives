SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native  Americans in Science (SACNAS) recognized the research efforts of three UC  Santa Cruz undergraduate students at its recent national conference, held  October 24-27 in Los Angeles.

Dynela Garcia, a senior in biochemistry, was one of three recipients of  the $1,250 SACNAS-Eli Lilly Scholarship, awarded to students who plan to  pursue advanced degrees. Garcia, who aims for a career in biomedical  research, will apply to Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D. programs in 1998. Her research  with professor of chemistry Anthony Fink probed the structure and function  of an enzyme that creates resistance to penicillin. Starting next quarter, she  will work with professor of chemistry Phillip Crews on natural compounds  from marine sponges that may lead to useful drugs.

Yvonne Rodriguez, a senior in earth sciences, received a $500 Vigil  Poster Presentation Award, given to the four best undergraduate research  posters at the meeting. Rodriguez prepared a poster titled "Trace Elements  in Volcanic Rocks from the Izu Margin" with her adviser, lecturer Alfred  Hochstaedter. The team measured trace elements in rocks from the western  Pacific to trace the origins of volcanic activity there. ARCO funded a  summer internship for Rodriguez through UCSC's ACE (ACademic Excellence)  Honors Program.

Maria Catalina, a junior in community studies, prepared a poster of her  research with associate professor of earth sciences Elise Knittle, titled  "Experimental Characterization of the Molecular Structure and Healing  Properties of a Clay Mineral." The research explored the properties of a waxy  mineral used by Native Americans for thousands of years to treat  gastrointestinal problems. Cornell University chemist and ethnobotanist  Eloy Rodriguez invited Catalina to publish her findings. She also will present  her work this month at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.

Both Rodriguez and Catalina are single mothers who live at UCSC's  Family Student Housing.

SACNAS, established in 1973 and headquartered since 1988 at UCSC,  encourages Chicano, Latino, and Native American students to pursue graduate  education and obtain the advanced degrees necessary for careers in research  and science education.
