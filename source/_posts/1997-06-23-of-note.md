Assistant art professor **Nobuho Nagasawa** (kneeling) and the students from her _Introduction to Three-dimensional Art_ class catch their breath after installing the art project, _Neo Geo Hypertufa._ The project was the result of a workshop with Seattle artist Vicki Scuri who came to UCSC for a four-day residency program sponsored by Porter College. Scuri, who is also working on a public art project in Watsonville, taught UCSC students how to construct and install organic hypertufa rock (a material made of cement, peat moss, and pearlite). During her residency, Scuri presented her workshop, worked with students, and delivered a public lecture. The installation is on display at Baskin Visual Arts Studios.
