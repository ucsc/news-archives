SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory will be closed all day on Tuesday, October 17, to accommodate a dedication ceremony for the center's new neighbor, a state-of-the-art national fisheries research laboratory.

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Norman Mineta and Representative Sam Farr are among those who will be on hand to celebrate the completion of the new National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) laboratory. The Seymour Center will host a reception for invited guests following the dedication ceremony.

The NMFS Santa Cruz Laboratory will conduct research on fisheries resources in the eastern Pacific Ocean, focusing primarily on salmon and rockfish. It will also house the first National Science Center for Marine Protected Areas. The $19.4 million laboratory replaces obsolete lab facilities in Tiburon.

Located adjacent to UC Santa Cruz's Long Marine Laboratory, the NMFS lab joins a growing complex of marine research facilities at this site.

The Seymour Center is normally open to the public Tuesday through Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. Visitors to the center can explore the marine life of Monterey Bay, visit exhibit galleries and the Ocean Discovery Shop, and enjoy unsurpassed vistas of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The Seymour Center is dedicated to educating people about the role scientific research plays in the understanding and conservation of the world's oceans. For additional information about the center, call (831) 459-3800.
