## In addition to endowment, gift includes rich archive of family  documents from the holocaust

SANTA CRUZ, CA--On the 50th anniversary of the end of World War  II, many holocaust survivors share this hope: that the world not  forget Hitler's program of genocide that killed 6 million Jews. "I  believe it is critical to perpetually study the circumstances  culminating in Hitler's final solution for the Jews," says Anne  Neufeld Levin, whose gift to the University of California, Santa Cruz,  has led to the establishment of an endowed chair in holocaust  studies on the campus.

"Only by remembering can we immortalize the millions of  victims and help to prevent a similar onslaught against any group,"  says Levin, who narrowly escaped Nazi persecution as a young child.  At the age of three, she fled from Austria with her parents, Henry  and Hedy Neufeld, just as Hitler's troops invaded Czechoslovakia. "A  miracle separated my escaping alive from the eventual annihilation  of my grandparents, aunts, and 6 million other Jews," Levin says.

One of just a handful of funded chairs in holocaust studies in  the U.S., the establishment of the Neufeld-Levin Holocaust Chair was  approved at today's (May 19, 1995) meeting of the Regents of the  University of California. The chair is supported by a $250,000  endowment. Along with the endowment, Levin is donating an  extensive family archive of holocaust-related materials.

In providing the endowment, Levin stipulated that the UCSC  chair have an interdisciplinary focus and public-outreach element.  "The holocaust touches many subjects; there are holocaust experts  in medicine, science, literature, and theater," she said. "I am hoping  that the creation of the chair is only a nucleus around which other  activities will be possible."

"This extraordinary gift will make it possible for faculty,  students, and the general public to learn from leading experts on and  off campus about one of the most tragic and significant events of  the twentieth century," says UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Karl S. Pister.  "And by donating her treasured family archive to the university,  Anne Levin gives us a very personal and poignant view of the  holocaust."

"The interdisciplinary aspect of this chair is quite unique,"  says Murray Baumgarten, a professor of English and comparative  literature at UCSC who co-teaches a course on campus about the  holocaust. "There are a lot of holocaust courses taught under the  heading of Jewish studies, but the problem with that is the  holocaust is not just a Jewish problem. To keep it isolated in Jewish  studies misses the point over and over again. The Bosnians, the  Cambodians, the Rwandans, and many others understand that this is  not a Jewish problem."

History professor Peter Kenez, who teaches the holocaust  studies course with Baumgarten, notes that the class is in great  demand. "It is obvious there is interest in this subject," Kenez  observes, noting, "We had close to 300 students enroll the last time  we offered the class. I expect we will see more and more  universities beginning to offer this course of study."

Holocaust studies will be greatly enhanced by Levin's archive- -a collection of documents, medals, stamps, artifacts, photos,  memorabilia, and letters, carefully preserved first by her parents  and then by Levin. "Many people destroyed these things as soon as the  war was over, but my father kept everything," she says.

Included in the archive is the letter Levin's father wrote to the  American couple who took in her brother when he was sent ahead of  the rest of the family. "My father wrote the letter thinking he would  never see my brother again," she says. Also included are the identity  papers, passports, and other correspondence that Levin's family  carried following the Nazi occupation of Austria. "Many of them are  marked with a big 'J' or have swastikas all over them," she says. Her  father's stamp collection, also in the archive, includes nearly every  stamp issued by the Third Reich. The archive will be housed in  Special Collections at the University Library.

Levin has been a longtime supporter and volunteer at UCSC.  Along with establishing the annual Neufeld-Levin Holocaust Lecture  Series, she is a former president of the UCSC Foundation as well as  a current board trustee. She served as co-chair of the Leadership  Opportunity Awards Scholarship Committee and as a member of  several other groups providing support to the university.
