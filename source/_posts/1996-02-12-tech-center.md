title: Berkeley-Based Firm Preparing Business Plan For UC's Technology Center At Fort Ord

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Work is under way on the second of two major  planning efforts to define the future of the University of California's  innovative MBEST Center--the Monterey Bay Education, Science, and  Technology Center at the former Fort Ord military reservation.

A consulting team headed by Economic & Planning Systems, a  land-economics firm based in Berkeley, is preparing a  comprehensive land-use and business plan for the MBEST Center.  Over the next several months, the team will chart a course for the  research and technology center grounded in the economic realities of  the marketplace, the needs of the Monterey Bay region, the physical  features of the site, and other practical concerns.

Project managers at UC Santa Cruz, lead campus in developing  the MBEST Center, hired Economic & Planning Systems late last year.  The firm's efforts will go hand in hand with those of the Economic  Competitiveness Group at DRI/McGraw-Hill, which began work last  October on a marketing study of the region's competitive assets.  Together, the two planning initiatives will lead to a long-range  blueprint for the MBEST Center--a blueprint that UCSC  administrators will present to the UC Board of Regents next year.

"The Regents have asked us to develop a project that is market  driven, financially feasible, and self-sustaining," says Mark Coburn,  the center's director of technology transfer and business planning.  "It must build on the competitive strengths of UC Santa Cruz and the  UC system, and it must make positive contributions to the economy  of the Monterey Bay region and the state. The business plan will  flesh out our concepts for the MBEST Center in all of these areas."

The U.S. Army has conveyed or will convey about 1,090 acres at  Fort Ord to the University of California. UCSC's plans call for  developing the industrial research and technology center on 485  acres. The remaining 605 acres will become part of the UC Natural  Reserve System, preserved as unique coastal chaparral.

Current projections for the MBEST Center envision several  million square feet of space in new buildings for research and  development, industry, offices, retail, education, and lodging,  constructed over the next 40 to 50 years. Existing studies have  concluded that the center's activities could support several thousand  new jobs during the next 20 years and potentially up to 12,000 jobs,  making the center the largest single generator of employment at the  former base. As such, regional officials point to the MBEST Center  and the adjoining California State University, Monterey Bay, as the  cornerstones to the successful reuse of the property and to the  economic rebirth of the region.

The UC Fort Ord Project team has identified four "market  niches" around which growth at the MBEST Center will revolve:  environmental science, technology, and instrumentation, especially  coastal applications; biotechnology, emphasizing agricultural and  marine applications; information science and technologies; and  multimedia education and entertainment. The team chose those areas  for their connections to existing regional strengths and for their  growth potential.

The Economic & Planning Systems study will explore the  logistical details of how to bring the center into being. "The  business plan will be a strategic blueprint to help link Fort Ord and  the Monterey Bay region to emerging high-technology markets," says  James Musbach, lead consultant on the MBEST study. Musbach's team  will focus on the following:
* A revised master plan for land use.
* A strategic development plan for the first five years of the  project.
* A comprehensive business plan, with short-term and long- term projections of the financial resources--predominantly  generated from the project itself--needed for the center to flourish.
* Agreements and jurisdictional understandings with  neighboring governments.
* A telecommunications plan for making the center a hub of  advanced communications infrastructure and technologies.
* Strategies for marketing, developing, and operating the  center, and for communicating with legislators, financiers, and  other key audiences.

Economic & Planning Systems, one of the leading business  development consulting firms in northern California, has an  established track record in real-estate economics, regional  economic development, and public finance. Consultants at the firm  have worked extensively on major reuse projects at military bases  throughout California and at the Stapleton International Airport and  the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant in Colorado. Subcontractors  on the business plan include the ROMA Design Group and  DRI/McGraw-Hill, both of San Francisco, and DMS Research & Consulting of Santa Cruz.

For its services, Economic & Planning Systems will receive  $335,000 from the UC Fort Ord Project. A $1.2 million grant from  the Economic Development Administration of the U.S. Department of  Commerce, received in April 1995, will pay for this and other  planning initiatives for the MBEST Center.
