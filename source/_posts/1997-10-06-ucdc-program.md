Undergraduate juniors and seniors in all majors can now enroll full-time in a Washington, D.C., program, the UCDC Program. Students take classes and intern at one of the many organizations or agencies in the D.C. area while fully enrolled as UCSC students.

The cost for the quarter is comparable to a quarter on campus at UCSC (plus travel), and need-based scholarships are available to aid in the cost of airfare and additional living expenses. Students are housed in a furnished apartment building in Arlington, Virginia.

Application materials are widely available throughout the campus, in departments, colleges, and student services offices.

Further information is available from Kim Tyler.
