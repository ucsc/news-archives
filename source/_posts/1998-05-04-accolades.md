**John Isbister, **professor of economics, is the recipient of a 1997 Myers Center Award for the Study of Human Rights in North America for his book _The Immigration Debate: Remaking America_ (Kumarian Press, 1996). In this book, Isbister presents the arguments on both sides of the current immigration debate and provides an analysis of the economic, demographic, ethical, and cultural issues that, he argues, must be considered in determining immigration policy. The award describes Isbister's book as an "outstanding work on intolerance in North America." The Myers Center, named for Gustavus Myers, who wrote _History and Bigotry in the United States_ (1943), was founded in 1984 to offer annual awards for the best scholarship on the subject of intolerance.
