Small-scale medical trials on cancer patients provide hope that gene therapy  could become a potent weapon in the fight against certain ovarian cancers  and breast cancers, an audience learned at UCSC on September 19.

University of Washington medical geneticist Mary-Claire King spoke to about 200 people at the Music Center Recital Hall in a public lecture  cosponsored by UCSC and the American Cancer  Society. In her talk, "Genetic Analysis of Breast and Ovarian Cancer," King  reviewed the evidence--much of it found by her team--that genetically  inherited mutations trigger about 10 percent of all cases of these devastating  diseases in women.

"If we can learn about the genes that are critical to the normal  development of these cells through studying families in which the genes  have gone awry, then we can learn more about these cancers in general,"  King said.

King revealed the details of a federally approved, "phase I" clinical trial on  12 women with terminal ovarian cancer, caused in each case by a genetic  predisposition to the disease. When researchers introduced large amounts of  the healthy, unmutated gene into the women's peritoneal cavities, King said,  many of their ovarian tumors stopped growing. Her team will publish the  results in November.

The gene of concern is called BRCA1, pinpointed by King and others in  1990 as playing a role in some breast and ovarian cancers. She and her  colleagues have since shown that mutations in a related gene, called BRCA2,  also contribute to cancer development. The U.S. Food and Drug  Administration has granted permission to King's team for a "phase II" gene  therapy clinical trial on a larger number of women with ovarian cancer, as  well as for a phase I trial on women with advanced BRCA1-related breast  cancer.

Overall, King said, our understanding of the genesis of breast and ovarian  cancer remains poor. For instance, physicians and researchers are uncertain  why the risks of contracting breast cancer continue to rise for women in  developed countries, especially the U.S., Canada, and in Europe. "Our  grandmothers had far lower risks of getting breast cancer than we do now,"  she said. "That change is not due to inherited genetics."

Indeed, King noted, the risk of women in the audience's social class  developing breast cancer is the same as the risk of a two-pack-a-day smoker  getting lung cancer, a statistic that startled her listeners.

The major risk factors, King observed, appear to be earlier onsets of  menstruation, later ages of childbearing, and later onsets of menopause. Most  notably, diet, exercise, and overall good health among girls have pushed  initial menstruations to younger ages, while higher education and job  pressures force women to start their families later in life. That leaves more  time for estrogen and other hormones to affect the breasts and other tissues  in ways that scientists do not yet grasp.

"In some way, our technology has brought with it a change in lifestyle and  an increase in the rate of breast cancer," King said. "It is our responsibility to  use this technology we have now mastered and bring it to bear on the  problem of cancer."

King's talk was part of the American Cancer Society's first Schilling  Research Conference, funded by a $1.6 million bequest to the society from  the late Col. Frank K. Schilling of Santa Cruz in honor of his wife, Else H.  "Henny" Schilling. UCSC professor of biology Frank Talamantes, who also  conducts federally funded research on breast cancer, helped to arrange King's  visit to UCSC.
