Historian **Alice Yang Murray** spoke with Eric Schoeck for KUSP-Radio's _Talk of the Bay_ show on a range of subjects from Women's History Month to the World War II Japanese internment. . . . Also covering Women's History Month this week was the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel,_ which featured a story on a new book on women's history edited by political scientist **Gwendolyn Mink**. Both Mink and hist. con.'s **Angela Davis** were quoted for the story. In an inspired moment, Mink advised the reporter that the book "belongs in every press room."

The _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ reported on research on oil-spill clean-up taking place in the lab of environmental toxicologist **Ron Tjeerdema.** Tjeerdema and his colleagues are studying the effects on marine organisms of using detergents for dispersing oil after a spill.

Reference librarian **Kathryn Blackmer Reyes** was interviewed on the story of the California Digital Library for Spanish-language Channel 67.

The _Monterey County Herald_ covered a talk on toxic algae by marine biologist **Mary Silver** to the Friends of Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. Silver, who spent her sabbatical last year studying toxic algae in Zanzibar, is talking to local fisherman to find out more about conditions in Monterey Bay.
