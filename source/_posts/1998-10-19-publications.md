[NOVAntiqua,][2] the dance company of professor of theater arts **Mark Franko,** just premiered the show "Histories of Water" in San Francisco's ODC Theater. Franko founded NOVAntiqua in New York in 1985 and relocated the company to San Francisco in 1995. The company has appeared at Lincoln Center Out-of-Doors Festival, the Clark Studio Theater at Lincoln Center, Brady Street Dance Center, Berlin Werkstatt Festival, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Toulon Art Museum, the Montpellier Opera, and in many other national performance venues.

**Miriam Hill,** systems and resource analyst for the Division of the Arts, is coauthor (with Robert Anton Wilson) of _Everything Is Under Control: Conspiracies, Cults and Cover-Ups._ The book was published by HarperCollins in July and has already gone into a second printing. Hill worked on the project for two years, researching and writing on conspiracy theories and notes that, "One unique aspect of the book that I take a tremendous amount of pride in is that we solicited help from the outside world via the Internet. We asked people to tell us their favorite conspiracies and we were flooded with responses." The book investigates a range of conspiracy theories from the well-known Kennedy assassinations to the obscure Mothman prophecies. The book is arranged by alphabetical entries which include cross-reference to other entries in the book and also provide addresses to related sites on the Web.

**Margaret Morse, **associate professor of film and video, is the author of _Virtualities: Television, Media Art, and Cyberculture._ The book is published by Indiana University Press and examines the effects of television, video, and computers--what Morse calls "virtual practices"--on our sense of reality.

**Felicia Rice,** a UCSC staff member and lecturer and owner of Moving Parts Press, has published _Codex Espangliensis: From Columbus to the Border Patrol._ The book is a collaborative work made up of performance texts and poems by Guillermo Gómez-Peña with collage imagery by Enrique Chagoya. The work was letterpress printed by Rice and is housed in a portfolio box made by Maureen Carey, a member of the University Library staff. The work is featured through November 8, 1998, in an exhibition--"From Columbus to the Border Patrol: Codex Espangliensis Guillermo Gomez-Pena, Enrique Chagoya, and Felicia Rice"--at the Museum of Art and History at the McPherson Center in Santa Cruz.
