title: Further Evidence Of Different Rupture Process For Deep Earthquakes

SANTA CRUZ, CA--For the third time in three years, researchers at  the University of California, Santa Cruz, have unearthed evidence  that the world's deepest quakes rupture the planet in a markedly  different way than their shallow and more damaging cousins.

For their latest study, seismologists Heidi Houston and John  Vidale examined how deep earthquakes release their energy over  time. They found that on average, the deepest events--up to 430  miles beneath the earth's surface--get started quickly, build rapidly  to a crescendo, then end just as quickly, creating a symmetric  pattern of energy release. In contrast, quakes closer to the surface  last longer and do not end nearly as abruptly, on average. Instead,  their energy output tails off more gradually and in a more varied  way.

The difference, the researchers say, stems from a mysterious  change in how earthquake faults rifle through deep rock. Higher  temperatures and pressures far below the surface may create a more  uniform environment that a quake can rupture in one smooth pulse.  Alternatively, the faulting process for deep quakes may be radically  different, triggered by changes in the structures of minerals rather  than brittle failure along a plane of rock.

"There appears to be something fundamentally different  happening on the fault plane at depth," says Houston, a seismologist  at UCSC's Institute of Tectonics. "There's a difference in the degree  of complexity, but we don't know whether it's in the bulk material or  in the faulting process itself." Even with that uncertainty, she says,  geophysicists studying this hot topic now have another constraint  for their models of the physical mechanisms by which deep quakes  occur.

Houston and Vidale, who is affiliated with both UCSC and the  U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, published their work in the  August 5 issue of the journal Science.

The paper complements two previous UCSC studies on the  seismic characteristics of deep earthquakes. In a 1991 report in  Nature, Houston and UCSC mineral physicist Quentin Williams  described evidence that deep quakes, once they start, reach their  peak motions almost twice as quickly on average as shallow ones.  Last year in Nature, Vidale and Houston showed that the same deep  quakes typically last only about half as long as ones closer to the  surface.

The new study yielded a more qualitative characteristic: the  "envelope" of an earthquake's energy release, a curve that traces out  how much energy the quake produces at each point in time from  beginning to end. However, because the precise ending time of an  earthquake is a challenge to discern, deriving those shapes was a  massive chore.

The researchers gathered recordings of 169 large earthquakes  at least 60 miles deep that struck around the Pacific Rim between  1980 and 1992. With seismic traces available from hundreds of  seismometers in California and Washington, the amount of data was  formidable: Vidale estimates that during a two-month span, he  looked at 50,000 seismic traces--rejecting the noisiest ones--and  picked earthquake start times for 20,000 of them. Technical reasons  made 47 of the earthquakes unusable, leaving 122 events in the final  study.

Then, Houston and Vidale relied upon a statistical phenomenon  to nail down the end of each quake. By adding together many seismic  traces in a computer and aligning them to the same start time, they  reduced the echoes, noise, and other local effects that normally  obscure the point at which a quake actually stops. That reduction  goes as the square root of the number of traces; stacking together  100 traces for the same earthquake, for instance, cuts the noise by a  factor of 10. The result: a clean "average" seismogram for each  event.

Next, the researchers computed the envelope of each average  seismogram. Envelopes for simple events looked like bell-shaped  curves, with most of the energy release in the middle. For complex  events, many envelopes had peaks and valleys, showing how the  earthquakes waxed and waned. Finally, to explore differences in the  envelopes of earthquakes at various depths, Houston and Vidale  stretched all of the envelopes to the same length and averaged  groups of them together.

For the deepest events (325-435 miles), the average envelope  was quite symmetric, ending almost as abruptly as it began.  Between 220 and 325 miles deep, endings became more gradual.  Envelopes for the shallowest events studied (60-220 miles, but still  regarded by seismologists as "intermediate" in depth) were the least  symmetric of all.

"These intermediate-depth earthquakes end more gradually  than deep ones," says Houston. "That's new information. For the deep  events, it's interesting to see how simple they look on average. But  we're looking at averages of an average, and any one earthquake can  deviate significantly from that pattern."

The trend toward asymmetric energy release might continue  with even shallower earthquakes, says Vidale, if the planet's  outermost 60 miles grows less and less uniform. The researchers  hope to conduct such a study, but seismic records from quakes close  to the surface are much noisier and harder to analyze than those  from deep events, Vidale notes.

This new approach could shed light on shallow and damaging  ruptures, says Houston: "If shallow quakes are asymmetric, we  would infer that heterogeneity is important to the rupture. This has  implications for understanding the physics of ruptures and possibly  for earthquake prediction."
