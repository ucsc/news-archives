John G. Davies, a San Diego attorney who has been a member of the University of California Board of Regents for six years, has been elected by  his colleagues to chair the university's governing board. The Regents,  meeting today (Friday, June 19) in San Francisco, unanimously selected Davies to be chair of the 26-member board. They also named Frank  W. Clark Jr., a Los Angeles attorney, to the position of vice chairman. Both will serve one-year terms beginning July 1, 1998.

Davies succeeds Regent Meredith J. Khachigian, whose term chairing the  board expires June 30. Davies, 63, currently is Gov. Pete Wilson's judicial  appointments secretary. He also serves of counsel in the law firm of Allen,  Matkins, Leck, Gamble & Mallory in San Diego. He holds degrees from the  University of Southern California and the Boalt Hall School of Law at UC  Berkeley.

A San Diego native, Davies has served as member and chairman of the San  Diego Planning Commission and as director and president of the Centre City Development Corporation in San Diego. He also chaired then-Senator Wilson's California Judicial Qualification Committee from 1983 to 1990 and performed the same role for former Sen. John Seymour in 1991-92.

Davies was appointed to the Board of Regents by Gov. Wilson in 1992 and his term on the board runs until 2004. He most recently chaired the board's Committee on Health Services. Clark is a senior partner in the law firm of  Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara & Samuelian in Los Angeles. He was appointed  to the Board of Regents in 1980 by then-Governor Jerry Brown and  reappointed in 1988 by then-Governor George Deukmejian.

Clark graduated from UCLA and holds a law degree from Hastings College of  the Law.

The board also selected the following Regents to chair the board's standing committees for the year beginning July 1: Tom Sayles (Audit); Ward Connerly (Educational Policy); S. Sue Johnson (Finance); David S. Lee (Grounds and Buildings); Meredith J. Khachigian (Health Services); Gerald L. Parsky (Investments); and Peter Preuss (Oversight of the Department of Energy Laboratories). In addition, the board appointed Regent Carol Chandler as its representative to the California Postsecondary Education Commission and  named Khachigian as the alternate representative. Each will serve a two-year  term beginning July 1.
