SANTA CRUZ, CA--A gene linked to the most common abdominal  cancer in children also may contribute to the development of breast  cancer, according to a study at the University of California, Santa  Cruz, and Oregon Health Sciences University.

A team led by UC Santa Cruz biologist Gary Silberstein found  evidence that a gene called WT1, which prevents abnormal cell  division in the kidney, also is active in healthy breast tissues.  However, the gene was silent, or nearly so, in two-thirds of the  cancerous breast tissues examined by the team. These tissues  included tumors in their earliest stages of growth--just a few cells  beginning to run amok.

The study is the first to make a connection between breast  cancer and WT1, so named because of its role in the childhood kidney  cancer called Wilm's tumor. The team published its research today  (July 22) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

"It is not inconceivable that the loss of WT1 function is an  early event in the progression to breast cancer," said Silberstein, an  associate research biologist at UCSC. "This really is a brand-new  finding, a once-in-a-lifetime connection that should open new  avenues of breast-cancer research."

Silberstein emphasized that the research will not lead to new  medical or preventive treatments in the near future. However, by  shedding light on the cellular machinations of diseased breasts, it  may give researchers a new strategy as they attempt to devise "gene  therapy" approaches to restore the normal functions of genes that  stunt the growth of tumors.

Silberstein led the study in the laboratory of Charles Daniel,  research professor of biology at UCSC. Other coauthors included  Charles T. Roberts, Jr., professor of pediatrics at Oregon Health  Sciences University and an expert on Wilm's tumor, and UCSC  researchers Katharine Van Horn and Phyllis Strickland.

The scientists received samples of both healthy and diseased  breast tissues via Daniel's ongoing collaboration with physicians at  Dominican Santa Cruz Hospital, most notably pathologist Dr. Kelly  O'Keefe and surgeon Dr. John Snyder. All tissues were obtained with  the informed consent of patients. Other samples came from the  University of Michigan's Breast Tissue Bank.

WT1, it appears, is among a chain of genes that helps govern  the production of important hormones, called growth factors, in both  the kidney and the breast. The growth factors are part of a fine- tuned hormonal system of checks and balances that controls the  extent to which cells proliferate. WT1's key targets in the cell are  hormones known as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and  transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b). Research in the labs of  Daniel and others has shown that both IGFs and TGF-b are crucial to  regulating growth in mammary glands.

When WT1 does its job, it instructs the cell to churn out  proteins that manage the amount of IGFs and TGF-b. "WT1 essentially  is a middle-management gene," Silberstein said. "It's expressed in an  exceedingly complex way--it's basically four genes in one. But there  is a direct connection between WT1 and factors that control the  growth of breast tissues."

The researchers examined normal tissues from the breasts of  six patients who had undergone breast-reduction surgery at  Dominican Hospital. The WT1 protein was present in cells from all of  these patients, indicating that the gene was active and functioning  properly.

Then, the team looked at tissues excised from 21 breast- cancer patients, ranging in age from 29 to 88 years. In 40 percent of  all the tumors studied, the researchers could not detect the WT1  protein--the gene, for unknown reasons, had malfunctioned or fallen  silent. In another 28 percent of the tumors, most of the cells lacked  the WT1 protein.

"The story is complex, because it has been difficult to find a  single molecular or genetic defect that is common to all the various  forms of breast tumors," said Roberts, who directs the Doernbecher  Pediatric Research Laboratories at OHSU. "Finding abnormal WT1  activity in several types of breast cancer suggests that defects in  WT1 action may underlie many forms of breast cancer."

Curiously, the WTI gene was active in a highly malignant  subset of advanced breast tumors, called estrogen receptor-negative  tumors. However, the researchers also detected another well-known  tumor suppressor gene, called p53, in these malignant cells. Those  two genes can interact, so p53 may interfere with WT1's normal  function.

There is no evidence of a mutation in the WT1 gene, Silberstein  said, so WT1 would not be a factor in hereditary breast cancers. No  relationship is yet evident between the WT1 gene and the previously  discovered BRCA I and II genes, which play a role in hereditary forms  of breast cancer. Those cases comprise 5 to 10 percent of all breast  cancers.

Silberstein, Daniel, and their UCSC colleagues are completing a  study of the developmental regulation of WT1 in the mammary  glands of mice. Early results support the findings from human  tissues: the gene's products are absent in precancerous tissues but  present in more mature tumors.

The research was supported by grants from the National  Institutes of Health to the laboratories of both Daniel and Roberts.
