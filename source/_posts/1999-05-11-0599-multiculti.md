## 20th Annual Multicultural Festival At UC Santa Cruz

SANTA CRUZ, CA-On Saturday, May 29, UC Santa Cruz's East Field will become a cultural mecca as the campus hosts the 20th annual Multicultural Festival.

The celebration of international cultures takes place from noon to 5:30 P.M. and offers live entertainment and a wide variety of traditional ethnic foods. One of UCSC's most popular events, the Multicultural Festival brings together more than 5,000 participants each year to dance, eat, and celebrate the many cultures represented at UCSC.

The event is open to the public. Admission is $2 for UCSC students, faculty, and staff, and $10 for all others.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Multicultural Festival, and a special program has been planned. Scheduled performances include traditional dance of the Philippines by Pagkakaisa; Mexican folkloric dance by Los Mejicas; and reggae and hip-hop music by the popular bands Native Elements and Medusa. Brazilian samba will round out the musical menu.

Student organizations will serve a wide variety of traditional ethnic foods reflecting UCSC's diverse student population. From sushi to enchiladas, gumbo, falafel, and bulgogi (Korean barbecue), festival food booths sell out every year.

More than 20 of UCSC's student organizations sponsor the festival, with the goal of promoting appreciation of California's cultural diversity.
