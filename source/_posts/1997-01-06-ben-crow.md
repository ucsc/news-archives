**Ben Crow** 
 
Assistant Professor of Sociology  

Ben Crow studies international development issues with a focus on water and agriculture. Crow's current focus is on peasant agriculture in south Asia; he has spent almost ten years studying the rural rice and finance markets of Bangladesh, exploring the thesis that access to markets varies by social class and gender. Crow, whose work draws upon economics, sociology, and anthropology, was trained as a civil engineer. He earned his B.Sc. in civil engineering from Central London Polytechnic (now Westminster University), and his Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh.
