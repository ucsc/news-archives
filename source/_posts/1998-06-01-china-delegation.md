Five visitors from China spent the day at UCSC on May 22, touring the campus, meeting with faculty members, students, staff, and Chancellor Greenwood. Their visit was part of a two-week trip to northern California hosted by area Rotary Clubs. The trip is the third to take place in four years through the Rotary Club's Chinese Friendship Exchange Program. Along with the three visits here and one by  Santa Cruz Rotarians to China, the program has facilitated a student exchange and the purchase and delivery of equipment to a pediatric hospital in China.

The delegation members all have affiliations with the Chinese Association for International Understanding (CAFIU), which serves some of the same functions as a Rotary Club. Other Santa Cruz stopovers for the delegation were the Raytek Corporation and UCSC's Long Marine Lab.
