title: New Hours, Services Offered At Main Gate Kiosk

Buying one-day parking permits and getting campus directions and information just got a little bit easier.

Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) has expanded the hours of its Main Gate Kiosk from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. Faculty, staff, and campus visitors can buy one-day "A" permits and get directions and information at the kiosk, located just north of the main campus entrance.

Kiosk staff can also help offices and departments with guest parking permits and assist with parking for special events. Services are expected to be further expanded once the kiosk has been connected electronically with the TAPS database.

Faculty and staff who want to leave guest permits at the kiosk for a guest to pick up should deliver the completed parking permits to the kiosk during business hours or mail them, in advance, with instructions to the TAPS Sales Office. If guests are expected to pay for a permit, the host office or department should notify them in advance.

People sponsoring events on campus are encouraged to contact the TAPS Sales Office two weeks in advance of the event to discuss possible special arrangements for parking and transportation.

Kiosk staff cannot assist faculty or staff who have an annual or multi-year "A" permit or "A" packet and who need a temporary permit for a loaner vehicle. People with those permits must continue to go to the TAPS Sales Office for assistance.

For more information or to discuss additional ways that the kiosk staff can assist the campus, call Susan Duncan, TAPS sales office manager.
