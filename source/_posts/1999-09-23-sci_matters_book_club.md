## Science Book Club Will Discuss The Fates Of Human Societies At Next Meeting In October

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Science Matters Book Club, which meets each month at the Central Branch of the Santa Cruz Public Library, holds its meeting for next month on Sunday, October 17, from 2 to 4 p.m. Mike Dalbey, a lecturer in biology at UC Santa Cruz, will lead a discussion of Jared Diamond's Pulitzer Prize-winning book "Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies."

The book club is open to the general public and focuses on nontechnical science books. Each discussion is led by a member of the local scientific community with expertise in the subject of that month's book. Meetings are usually on the third Sunday of each month.

The book club is sponsored by the Santa Cruz Public Libraries, the UC Santa Cruz Science Library, the Cabrillo College Library, the Association for Women in Science - Monterey Bay, the Capitola Book Cafe, and the Santa Cruz City Museum of Natural History. The Capitola Book Cafe offers a 10 percent discount to members of the book club for the monthly selections.

"This book club was created to provide a forum for readers of lay science books to be able to ask questions of professionals in the field," said Victoria Welborn, reference librarian at the UCSC Science Library. "It also provides a forum for scientists to discuss their work with nonscientists."
