MT. HAMILTON, CA--Computers soon will take total control of a 30-inch telescope at Lick Observatory, making it the most sensitive  fully robotic telescope anywhere.

The Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT), built by  astronomers at the University of California, Berkeley, will be  dedicated Friday, October 25, by officials from UC Santa Cruz, which operates the observatory atop Mt. Hamilton east of San Jose,  California. UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood will lead the  dedication, which is not open to the public.

The instrument is named for the Sylvia and Jim Katzman  Foundation of Saratoga, which donated $50,000 at a critical time in  the telescope's development, said Alex Filippenko, professor of  astronomy at UC Berkeley and leader of the seven-year effort to  build the instrument.

Much of the rest of the funding for KAIT, which totaled about  half a million dollars, came from the National Science Foundation in  the form of a Presidential Young Investigator Award to Filippenko in  1989.

KAIT will devote itself full-time to checking the night sky for  flaring supernovas, to following the changing brightnesses of  variable stars, or to observing any object that changes over short or  long periods of time. And since it is totally under computer control  it can easily be redirected to new targets at an astronomical whim.

The astronomers even hope to give students ready access to  the instrument to conduct nightly studies of changing celestial  objects, from orbiting moons to comets and asteroids.

"With this telescope, the University of California and Lick  Observatory jump to the forefront of research and science education  using robotic telescopes," Filippenko said.

"This project fit hand-in-glove with my longtime interests in  astronomy and computer engineering," said Jim Katzman, cofounder  of Tandem Computers and a member of the Dean's Advisory Council  for the Natural Sciences Division at UCSC. "Sylvia and I thought this  was a unique and exciting project, because it will allow  astronomers to do serious science remotely and to schedule  observations that aren't possible with normal telescopes."

KAIT can track a given area of the sky for hours, better than  any other robotic telescope now in operation. During a half-hour  observation it can detect objects 10,000 times fainter than other  such telescopes, or a million times fainter than the human eye can  see unaided.

In 1991 Filippenko took over operation of another 30-inch UC Berkeley telescope at Leuschner Observatory that had been  automated by astronomers at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, but it  could not remain fixed on a given star for more than a few minutes.  He subsequently modified a 20-inch telescope, also at Leuschner,  turning it into a prototype of KAIT called the Berkeley Automatic  Imaging Telescope (BAIT).

Both Leuschner telescopes were too old to withstand constant  use, however, so Filippenko terminated their robotic capabilities to  focus on finishing the new 30-inch automatic telescope at Lick  Observatory. Both BAIT and KAIT were constructed with the help of  engineer Dick Treffers, who improved and rebuilt much of the  purchased instrumentation, and former graduate student Michael  Richmond, who contributed to the operations software.

One major difference between KAIT and previous robotic  telescopes is the tracking system. KAIT has a separate CCD imaging  system for a guide star that allows it to remain precisely fixed on a  given area of sky. Other robotic telescopes employ simpler tracking  that allows a star to drift significantly in a couple of minutes.

Another key improvement is complex software that makes it  easy to orchestrate a night's observing. Targets are entered with a  priority number and the computer determines when and how long  during the night to look at each one. The computer can automatically  change the effective priority of a given target, depending on whether  observations were successful in preceding nights. Target requests  are sent via email, and data returned via the Internet to the  astronomer's computer, or to a school.

The images are captured on electronic film--a CCD camera,  like today's camcorders but much better quality, that integrates the  amount of light coming through the telescope and spits out a final  image at the end of the observation time. Depending on how bright  the object is, this could be one second to minutes later, with a  practical limit of about half an hour.

Filippenko's main interest is exploding stars or supernovas,  which flare suddenly into very bright objects and then dim to  obscurity within weeks or months. Capturing the entire process once  the supernova is detected requires nightly observation, which on  short notice is often impossible to arrange.

"If you want to monitor an exploding star you often have to  plead with colleagues for a small amount of time each night,  sometimes at telescopes all around the world," he said. "It's not easy  to do this, and the data are often of heterogeneous quality in a  situation where slight differences are important.

"So I embarked on a project to build an automated, dedicated  telescope that could be used for a variety of projects: searching for  supernovas, monitoring known variable stars, supernovas and novas,  looking at quasars and active galaxies, and very importantly, homing  in on targets of opportunity."

One important use of KAIT may be for quick-hit observations.  Astronomers frequently need to know how bright an object is so they  can estimate how much time to reserve on larger and more expensive  telescopes. KAIT can easily accommodate such brief observations.

"I'm already getting requests from people who need to know,  for example, the brightness variations of a quasar so they can judge  how much time they will need on the Hubble Space Telescope,"  Filippenko said.

KAIT, located at 1,280 meters elevation, has 20 filters that  can be shifted into position automatically for each new observation.

Other contributors to the telescope include the University of  California, The California Space Institute, Sun Microsystems,  Photometrics Ltd., AutoScope Corporation, and Lick Observatory.

Lick Observatory, which opened in 1888, is used by faculty and  students throughout the UC system. Its primary observing  instrument is the 120-inch Shane Telescope, which began collecting  data in 1959. Recently, astronomers Geoffrey Marcy and Paul Butler  of San Francisco State University and UC Berkeley used the Shane  Telescope and an ultrasensitive device, the Hamilton Spectrograph,  to detect evidence of at least half a dozen new planets outside of  our solar system.

UC also owns a share of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii  and its 400-inch telescopes, Keck I and Keck II. Both Lick  Observatory and UC's share of Keck Observatory are administered by  UC Santa Cruz within one unit, UC Observatories/Lick Observatory.
