SANTA CRUZ, CA--Barry McLaughlin, an expert on bilingual education, will  give a free public talk titled "The Good News About Bilingual Education," on  Tuesday, November 12, from 6 to 8 P.M. at Temple Beth-El in Aptos. The  address is 3055 Porter Gulch Road. His talk will be followed by a discussion  with a panel of local educators.

"The good news is that there are some very effective programs that  are doing exciting things to challenge students who have limited capacity  with English," says McLaughlin, a professor of psychology at the University  of California, Santa Cruz.

Some of the most effective features, revealed in a national study of  effective programs for limited English speakers, include a curriculum that  makes connections across disciplines, thematic learning, students working in teams, and teacher professionalism. Moreover,  teachers in the most successful programs were fluent in the native language  of the students and were trained in second-language learning.

"Many of the strategies we observed are used by teachers in schools in  this area, but some of them will be less familiar," added McLaughlin.

Perhaps the best news is that what works with students who have  limited English skills also works for native English speakers. "These  methods are effective for all children," says McLaughlin. "These schools are  doing good things for all of their kids, not just the bilingual students. What  we're talking about is high-quality education."

McLaughlin is the author of Second-Language Acquisition in Childhood  and Theories of Second-Language Learning. He was director of the Bilingual  Research Center at UCSC and the National Center for Research on Cultural  Diversity and Second Language Learning. He is now directing a research  project on bilingual vocabulary development with scholars from Harvard  University and the National Academy of Sciences.

Refreshments will be served. Call (408) 459-3351 for more  information.
