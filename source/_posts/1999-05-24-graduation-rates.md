SANTA CRUZ, CA-The University of California, Santa Cruz, is nationally ranked for the number of bachelor's degrees it confers on Hispanic students, according to a report in the magazine Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education.

The ranking was based on the 309 bachelor's degrees UC Santa Cruz awarded to Hispanic students in the 1996-97 school year, placing the campus 45th in the nation in that category.

The report appeared in Hispanic Outlook's April 23 issue and was based on information supplied by the National Center for Education Statistics for the 1996-97 academic year, the last year for which data has been tabulated. Approximately 2,300 four-year accredited colleges and universities were included in the assessment.

The list's top three universities are Florida International University, with 1,973 students graduated; the University of Texas at El Paso, with 1,141; and the University of Texas-Pan American, with 1,020.

UCSC also received mention for the relatively high number of Hispanic students studying in area/ethnic studies, biological sciences, English/literature, interdisciplinary studies, psychology, and social sciences.

Last year, Hispanic Outlook ranked UCSC 51st in the nation.

Hispanic Outlook is a twice-monthly, 28,000-circulation magazine directed at students, faculty, and administrators in higher education and at related associations and organizations.

The National Center for Education Statistics is a component of the U.S. Department of Education.
