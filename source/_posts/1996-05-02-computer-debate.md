**Event Features Pulitzer Prize-Winning Scientist Douglas Hofstadter And Composer/Programmer David Cope**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Is creativity a uniquely human ability? The  question is at the crux of ongoing debate, most recently embodied in  the chess match between Gary Kasparov and IBM supercomputer Deep  Blue. Weighing in on the debate at a May 22 symposium at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, will be Pulitzer Prize-winning  cognitive and computer scientist Douglas Hofstadter and  internationally respected composer and programmer David Cope.

The symposium, "Minds, Machine, and Music: Can Computers  Compose Creatively?," begins at 5 p.m. in UCSC's Performing Arts  Concert Hall. The event, which is free and open to the public, is  sponsored by the Board of Studies in Philosophy and UCSC's Mind and  Meaning Research Group. (A complete schedule is attached.)

Hofstadter, a professor of cognitive science and computer  science at Indiana University, Bloomington, is a leading thinker in  the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science. In the  early 1980s he helped crystallize the human versus machine debate  when he speculated that if a computer program were ever to  compose deep and original music or become world chess champion, it  would have to be as sophisticated as a human--possessing full  human intelligence and even consciousness.

At the same time, Cope, a professor of music at the University  of California, Santa Cruz, was at work on an artificial intelligence  program designed to compose its own music. The program, named  EMI, became operational in 1987. Pronounced "emmy" and short for  Experiments in Musical Intelligence, EMI composes original music in  the style of another composer using a complex six-step algorithm.  (See attached biographical notes for more details.)

Over the years the two professors have debated EMI's creative  ability, the creative abilities of computers in general, and the  nature of creativity. The symposium will be an opportunity for the  public to listen in on and participate in this lively debate, which  will be complemented with music composed by EMI.

"I look forward to addressing the very puzzling finding that the  music produced by Cope's model is definitely higher quality than I  had ever expected I would hear by a computer program of such  limited focus," Hofstadter said. "It has been enormously provocative  for me to run into something that I consider deep--musical  expression--that has nonetheless been produced by a mechanism  that, though quite complex, is certainly not nearly as deep or as  complex as a human mind. By this experience I have been powerfully  provoked to think not only about the music produced by EMI but also  to ponder the nature of music in general. I've been led to wonder, is  musical composition as emotionally profound and as deeply creative  a process as I'd always imagined?"

Cope has described the process EMI uses as similar to that of  human composers: "Very rarely do composers actually invent new  sounds but more often create imaginative new combinations of  sounds, many of which they've heard previously. In effect they are  recombining sounds and patterns into their own style."

"Creativity isn't such a big deal to me," Cope adds, "being good  at it is a big deal to me. Most people can compose a song or paint a  picture, but not many of us are Beethovens and Michelangelos. To me  it is a matter of elegance--how well a work achieves a certain  elegance."

Cope believes that in the future computer programs may be  capable of achieving elegant results. "We should not be biased  against this possibility simply because we have natural human- centered egos," Cope said, adding, "We should not define creativity  so narrowly that the definition itself precludes the possibility that  computer programs can be creative or create elegant works."

Hofstadter, on the other hand, speculates that there is  something deep missing, a kind of "motivating core" that derives  from human emotion and desire. "Right now programs like EMI and  others may do a good job at some level, but they don't have any of  that motivation humans gain from experiencing the complexities of  the world over a lifetime," he explains.

The debate continues May 22. For more information, call (408)  459-2070.

**Biographical Information**

**Douglas Hofstadter**

Hofstadter is a professor of cognitive science and computer  science at Indiana University, Bloomington, and director of the  Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition at Indiana University.

For nearly twenty years, Hofstadter has worked in the field of  artificial intelligence (AI). As a graduate student, he became  interested in both the workings of the brain and the potential of  computers to imitate the brain's thought processes. He subsequently  spent several years theorizing on aspects of the mind, machines,  formal systems for logical and mathematical reasoning, self- reference, and consciousness. His ideas were set down in the book  GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid, which won a Pulitzer  Prize in 1980. Among his other books are: The Mind's I: Fantasies and  Reflections on Self and Soul (1981), coedited with Daniel Dennett;  Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern  (1985);and, last year, Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies.  Hofstadter earned his Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1975 from the  University of Oregon.

Along with his work in AI, Hofstadter is interested in  translation and poetry and composes music.

**David Cope**

A professor of music at the University of California, Santa  Cruz, Cope is a respected composer whose works, in the genre of  twentieth century classical music, have been performed around the  world. He is the author of New Directions in Music, one of the most  popular textbooks on twentieth century music, now in its sixth  printing.

Cope began work on EMI in the early '80s when he was  commissioned by the University of Richmond to write an opera and  found himself facing a composing block. He conceived of an artificial  intelligence program that could serve as a composing tool to help  with the block. Cope completed EMI six years later, in 1987 and,  with EMI's help, finished his commission. Titled Cradle Falling, the  opera received rave reviews when it was performed. Cope uses EMI  as both a compositional tool and to understand style-- characteristics of a piece that make it recognizable as the work of a  specific composer.

Cope's EMI-related recordings are Bach by Design (1994) and  Dedications (forthcoming). EMI-related publications are Computers  and Musical Style (1991). Other publications include New Music  Composition (1977; second edition forthcoming) and New Music  Notation (1976). His newest book, Experiments in Musical  Intelligence, will be published in late May.

**EMI (Experiments in Musical Intelligence)**

Of the 100 or so programs in the world creating music through  computer algorithms, EMI is the only one that operates by analyzing  and recombining previously composed music. The works it has  produced have been performed in concert and released on the CD Bach  by Design (1994). Since it became operational in 1987, EMI has  created music in the styles of such composers as Mozart, Bach,  Stravinsky, Gershwin, Joplin, and Cope.

EMI's six-step algorithm works like this: The user carefully  selects and inputs compatible works of music from a composer  (pieces with similar tempos, ranges, and orchestration); EMI  analyzes them; identifies signatures (characteristics unique to the  composer); breaks the music into its components; recombines the  music into a new piece that preserves the composer's signatures;  and, ultimately, performs it.

Conference Schedule 5 p.m.--David Cope will present an overview of EMI, including  samples of works by EMI 6:30 p.m.--Dinner Break 8 p.m.--Douglas Hofstadter will share his perspective on EMI and  creativity. Pianist Mary Jane Cope will perform EMI works.  Following, Cope and Hofstadter will debate briefly and take  questions from the audience.
