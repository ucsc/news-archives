title: Two Professors To Share Appointment To Endowed Chair In  Environmental Studies At UC Santa Cruz

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Two assistant professors of environmental studies at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, have been appointed co-chairs of the  Pepper-Giberson Chair in Environmental Studies.

Daniel Doak and Daniel Press have been selected to hold the chair for  the next six years. Doak and Press are the first appointees to the chair,  which was established just over a year ago by a Los Gatos couple inspired by  their son's experience at UCSC. The appointment was announced today  (Wednesday, October 9) by UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood.

Both dedicated researchers and teachers, Doak and Press will use some  of the funds to hire undergraduate and graduate student researchers to work  on conservation issues. Doak's background is in biology, while Press is a  political scientist whose work addresses public policy issues; their  specialties are complementary, however, and together they help prepare  students for work that ranges from laboratory research to legislative  advocacy.

"Professor Doak and Professor Press represent a dynamic team in the  field of environmental studies, and I am pleased to name them as co-chairs  of the Pepper-Giberson Chair," said Greenwood. "This endowment will  support their work and enable them to accelerate the pace of their important  research. We appreciate the Gibersons' generosity and their commitment to  UC Santa Cruz."

Doak, who joined the faculty in 1992, is interested in using  quantitative methods to address problems in conservation biology. He  specializes in two areas: He conducts field research on the ecology of  plants, and he does mathematical modeling that is used to analyze data on  rare and endangered species of plants and animals. Doak's research includes  work on the ecology of rare plants found only in Santa Cruz and Monterey  counties, including the Ben Lomond spineflower. Like many rare plant  species, the spineflower has been at the center of a pressing land-use  debate. Doak has used his models to analyze the biological basis of  management decisions for species that include the spotted owl, desert  tortoise, grizzly bear, and sea otter.

Press, who also joined the faculty in 1992, specializes in  environmental policy and planning issues. He has embarked on an ambitious  multi-year project to study local open-space conservation efforts in  California. By examining local-government efforts to designate and preserve  open space, Press hopes to determine what environmental protection  activities local communities are capable of over the long-term. Citizens  may come to rely more on county efforts to preserve open space as state and  federal support for such programs dwindles, predicts Press, who is eager to  identify the factors that affect a county's performance in this area.

Doak and Press, who frequently guest lecture in each other's classes,  recently wrote their first co-authored article for a scientific journal, an  upcoming piece about local politics and local biology that represents the  intersection of their areas of expertise. Because the habitats of some rare  species are quite small, they represent parcels that could be purchased  locally as open space, say Doak and Press. "Open-space processes have been  underutilized for species conservation," says Doak, adding that it's "like  using a sledgehammer to crack open peanuts" to use federal or state  programs to protect a plant like the Ben Lomond spineflower, which grows  on only a few small parcels of land.

Doak and Press will also use some of the funds from the endowment to  bring in guest speakers, visiting professors, and in-residence scholars, and  to offer courses that might not otherwise be available.

The endowment was created by a $250,000 gift from Alan G. Giberson  and Margaret S. Lyons Giberson of Los Gatos. It was their son Erik's  experience as a UCSC undergraduate in environmental studies that moved the  Gibersons to make the gift. The endowed chair honors Professor Emeritus  James Pepper, whose teaching inspired Erik Giberson.

"We're delighted," said Margaret Giberson. "The appointments embody  what we were thinking of when we endowed the chair. Daniel Press and Dan  Doak promote the kind of teaching and the kinds of skills that will make a  difference in California and, with any luck, in the whole country. Education  is a key component in solving environmental problems."

Environmental studies is one of the most popular majors at UCSC,  which in 1994 became the first UC campus to offer a doctoral program in the  discipline.
