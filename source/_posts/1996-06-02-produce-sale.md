SANTA CRUZ, CA--Winter seemed to last forever, but spring is  finally here, and with spring comes the return of fresh organic  produce and flowers for sale at the main entrance of the UC Santa  Cruz campus. Ripe, juicy strawberries, kiwifruit, gourmet salad mix,  and lettuces will headline this year's early selection. Red and yellow  onions and bouquets of flowers will also be available.

Beginning on Friday, June 16, the cart will be open every  Tuesday and Friday afternoon from noon until 6 p.m. Look for the  market stand in front of the Barn Theater at the intersection of Bay  and High streets.

As spring fades to summer, the selection will broaden to  include sweet corn, flavorful dry-farmed tomatoes, peppers, apples,  plums, basil and other herbs, and more. Bounty from the UCSC Farm  and Garden will be available through the summer and into the fall,  depending on the length of the growing season. All proceeds benefit  the UCSC Center for Agroecology's apprenticeship program in  ecological horticulture. For more information, call (408) 459-4140.
