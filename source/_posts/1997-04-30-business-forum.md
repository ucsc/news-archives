SANTA CRUZ, CA--Representatives of local business and government are  invited to attend a forum on "Reaching International Markets" on Friday, May  16, from 8 A.M. to 1:30 P.M. in the Cypress Room at Peachwood's at the Inn at  Pasatiempo, Santa Cruz.

Presented by the Economics Advisory Board of the University of  California, Santa Cruz, the forum will cover subjects of interest to business  owners, government officials, and others seeking to operate in today's global  business environment. Topics will include laws and regulations, how to  identify customers, finance and risk management, timing and innovation, and  global economic trends. (See program below.)

"A firm doesn't have to be big anymore to be very involved with the  international economy," says UCSC Economics Professor Nirvikar Singh. "Even  small entrepreneurs who are thinking about where to sell are looking beyond  California, New York, and the midwest. For California businesses, in  particular, it's just as natural to look across the Pacific as to look to the East  Coast." Technology has made international business much easier, with  breakthroughs in communications and global financial markets that allow  companies in countries on opposite sides of the globe to use the same bank to  conduct transactions.

Globalization has bottom-line implications for business, many of which  will be discussed at the forum, including how to acquire short-term credit to  finance international trade, how to manage exchange-rate risk, and how to  target customers. Panelists will also provide current information on software  regulations and U.S. trade policy, says Singh.

The event is presented by the Economics Advisory Board at UCSC.  Established in 1995, the Advisory Board is made up of UCSC economics faculty  and business representatives from the community who are interested in  economics. Community members include representatives from Raytek, Smith  Barney, Inc., Coast Commercial Bank, and Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.

Advance registration is required. The cost is $30, which includes  breakfast, lunch, and refreshments. For information, call (408) 459-2028.Make checks payable to UC Regents and send to: Jennifer Hightower, Development Coordinator
