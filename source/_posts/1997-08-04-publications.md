The Center for Research on Education, Diversity & Excellence has issued its first research report. Titled _From At-Risk to Excellence: Research, Theory, and Principles for Practice,_ the report was written by professor of psychology and education **Roland Tharp,** who is director of CREDE.

The report details CREDE's research agenda and draws on findings from previous investigations that examined effective educational programs for students from linguistically and culturally diverse backgrounds. Tharp identifies principles for school reform, including recommendations for conceptualizing curricula and instruction, challenging students, and developing language and literacy competence through all instructional activities.

"CREDE is designed to move issues of risk, diversity, and excellence to the forefront of discussions concerning educational research, policy, and practice," said Tharp. "We are determined to produce a strong impact on policy and practice for the benefit of all children, and thus for the nation."

CREDE was established last year by the U.S. Department of Education, which selected UCSC to direct the five-year $20 million project to help students whose education is jeopardized by limited English proficiency, culture, race, poverty, and geographic location.
