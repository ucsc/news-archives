The Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics has made it onto another top-ten list, this time ranking tenth in the "America's Best Graduate Schools" guidebook for the year 2000, released last week by _U.S. News and World Report._

The specific category in which UCSC ranked tenth was "astrophysics/space," part of the _U.S. News_ rankings of Ph.D. programs in the sciences. In addition, the Department of Earth Sciences was ranked number 23 among Ph.D. programs in geology.

Last November, an independent national science group, the Institute for Scientific Information, rated UCSC the second most influential research university in the nation in the field of astrophysics.

The latest _U.S. News_ rankings and stories are available online on the .EDU site of U.S. News Online. The complete _U.S. News_ "America's Best Graduate Schools" guidebook will be available on newsstands and in bookstores starting Tuesday, April 6. The magazine issue containing excerpts from the guide and select ranking tables will appear on newsstands Monday, March 22 (issue dated March 29).
