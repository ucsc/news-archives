SANTA CRUZ, CA--An information session for people interested in volunteering at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center is scheduled for Thursday, August 17, from 6 to 7 p.m. at the Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab. The session will include information about the full range of volunteer opportunities at the center and details about the upcoming training class for volunteer docents.

The Seymour Center's volunteer docents serve as interpretive guides and receive training from the experts, including UCSC faculty and Seymour Center education staff. This year's volunteer training class will be held Tuesday evenings from September 19 through November 28. A stellar lineup of speakers will cover a variety of fascinating topics, including the natural history of Monterey Bay, marine biology, marine geochemistry, and coastal erosion.

Learn the steamy details of a sea hare's sex life. Find out how elephant seals can stay underwater for up to two hours (and that they exhale before diving). Learn about the "snow" that falls in the ocean depths.

Attend the August 17 information session to find out how to register for the training class and to learn about other volunteer opportunities. For more information, contact Sally Real at (831) 459-3854 or [sjreal@cats.ucsc.edu][2].
