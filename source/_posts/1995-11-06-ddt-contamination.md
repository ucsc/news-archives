title: DDT Contamination In Sea Lions Plummets A Hundredfold In Twenty Years

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Amid concerns about the lingering effects of DDT  along California's coast comes this bit of good news: Sea lions  carried about one hundred times less of the toxic substance in their  fat a few years ago than they did two decades earlier.

The average level of DDT and its major breakdown product,  DDE, was 5.2 parts per million in sea-lion blubber collected between  1988 and 1992. In contrast, blubber analyzed in 1970 contained an  average of 760 parts per million--an incredible quarter-pound of  DDT in each animal's body. Although DDT and DDE levels have dropped  in other animal populations over the same period, the decline in  California sea lions is the most precipitous yet seen. Researchers at  the University of California, Santa Cruz, conducted both studies.

The scientists say there is a direct link between this dramatic  change and the cessation of DDT dumping off southern California. The  Montrose Chemical Corporation, at the time the world's largest  manufacturer of DDT, flushed thousands of tons of DDT waste into  the ocean between 1949 and 1970. The waste polluted a huge gyre of  water near the Channel Islands, tainting much of the breeding  habitat for California sea lions.

Since then, the population of the species has more than  doubled, although factors other than lower DDT levels may have  helped them thrive. But even with this heartening progress,  researchers warn that the remaining amounts of DDT-related  chemicals still may inflict subtle harm on sea lions and other  marine mammals.

"The levels of DDT we measured in sea lions in 1970 were  extraordinarily high, essentially pharmacological doses," says UCSC  marine biologist Burney Le Boeuf. "Clearly the situation along the  coast has improved vastly since then. But I don't think we can say  that these substances no longer pose a problem for marine mammals,  because we don't know about possible long-term effects."

A team from UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences published the  follow-up study in the November 1995 issue of Marine Pollution  Bulletin. First author is Patricia Lieberg-Clark, who started the  project as an undergraduate at UCSC and now works at BioSystems  Analysis in Santa Cruz. Coauthors are staff research associates  Corinne Bacon of UCSC and Stephanie Burns, now at UC Davis;  researcher Walter Jarman; and Le Boeuf, a research professor of  biology.

Sea lions and other animals at the top of the coastal food  chain, such as falcons, pelicans, and eagles, bear the brunt of  environmental pollutants. DDE, PCBs, and other compounds become  more concentrated as they pass from lower to higher animals,  finally lodging in the brains and fatty tissues of birds and marine  mammals. DDE is most notorious for thinning the eggshells of birds  of prey, which nearly wiped out the state's peregrine falcons. Bald  eagles brought to the Channel Islands since 1980 still cannot hatch  their eggs, because DDE from the Montrose Chemical Corporation  bleeds out of nearby ocean sediments.

When Le Boeuf and former UCSC marine biologist Michael  Bonnell conducted their 1970 study, California sea lions faced major  reproductive problems. Various surveys found that nearly half of the  pups in each breeding season died after premature births. Suspecting  that DDT was the culprit, the researchers collected tissue samples  from animals--both from southern California and from Ano Nuevo,  north of Santa Cruz--that had died naturally or been shot by others.  Their stark results on DDT residues in 25 sea lions appeared in  Nature in November 1971. Only in brown pelicans, the authors noted,  had scientists observed such extreme levels.

For the follow-up study, Lieberg-Clark--who coordinated the  Marine Mammal Stranding Network for Santa Cruz County--collected  baseball-sized chunks of blubber from the carcasses of seven adult  or subadult male sea lions that washed ashore near Ano Nuevo or in  Monterey Bay. Under Jarman's direction, the team analyzed the DDT  and DDE content of the blubber at the Trace Organics Laboratory at  UCSC's Long Marine Lab. To compare the results with those from  1970, the team refigured Le Boeuf's data to include only the twelve  adult or subadult males in his study.

Studies from other DDT hot spots around the globe have found  tenfold drops in DDT residues in various animals since the early  1970s, the authors state. Declines in DDT levels in brown-pelican  eggs are the only well-documented figures to approach the same  hundredfold magnitude as the data from California sea lions.

Jarman extracts a lesson from the study--and words of  caution. "The waste from just one industrial plant was enough to  have a severe effect on an entire population of animals, because it  was dumped directly into their habitat," he says. "But the DDT levels  we found are not 'low,' they're just 'lower'--and they're still higher  than in marine mammals in many other parts of the world."
