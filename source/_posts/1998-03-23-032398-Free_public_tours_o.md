## Free Public Tours Of The UC Santa Cruz Farm Offered Weekly

SANTA CRUZ, CA--After a soggy winter, there's nothing like the sights and  sounds of spring to inspire the gardener in all of us. Come feed your  inspiration during a free docent-led tour of the  25-acre UC Santa Cruz Farm, where spring is literally bursting out all over.  The one-hour tours start Sunday, April 19, at 2 P.M.; they continue weekly  through the fall on Thursdays at noon and Sundays at 2 P.M.

Blossoming orchards, freshly planted garden beds, and perennial borders  buzzing with bees and birds are highlights of the tour. Visitors will also  receive information about organic methods for growing fruit, vegetables,  and flowers, as well as greenhouse techniques, compost-making, and the  university's research in sustainable agriculture. The green-thumbed among  us will appreciate learning about fruit, flower, and vegetable varieties that  thrive in the Monterey Bay region.

Tours start at the Farm's entrance gate, located up the gravel path from  the historic Blacksmith Shop near the base of campus. The Alan Chadwick  Garden, located below Merrill College on upper campus, is also open to  visitors.

For more information on tours, or to arrange a special tour, call (408)  459-3248. For directions, call 459-4140. For more information about the  Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, which operates the  UCSC Farm & Garden, check the center's Web site at zzyx.ucsc.edu/casfs.
