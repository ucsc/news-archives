SANTA CRUZ, CA--Two sons colluded in a self-described conspiracy to  surprise their mother and before they were done they had inveigled  respectable members of the local community, top campus  administrators, and three former chancellors to join in the scheme.

The sons, Mark Engel of Santa Cruz and Charlie Engel of  Beverly Hills, plotted to surprise their mother, Ruth, by establishing a  library endowment in her honor at the University of California, Santa  Cruz. The endowment was announced on December 13 at the annual  Dickens holiday gathering at the McHenry Library.

Close to 200 friends, family, and colleagues turned out to honor  Mrs. Engel, who was working at the event as a volunteer. Mrs. Engel  listened in surprise as her sons announced the establishment of the  Ruth Franklin Engel Horticulture Collection.

The collection was established through the library's subject  endowment program. Library subject endowments, created with a  contribution of $10,000 or more, are an important means of  expanding the library collection. The private funds provide a source  of ongoing support for acquisitions in a specific area of interest. A  special bookplate designed with a beautiful hand-drawn rose will  bear the endowment name on all books purchased through this fund.

"Mom has always been utterly opposed to such flagrantly un- anonymous donations," Mark Engel observed before the ceremony.  But her sons proceeded anyway, eager to acknowledge Mrs. Engel's  dedication as a longtime UCSC volunteer. The sons chose the subject  of horticulture for the library endowment, tying together Mrs. Engel's  twin interests of gardening and the library.

Both Mrs. Engel and her son Mark are members of the Friends  of the UCSC Library. Before resigning earlier this year, Mrs. Engel had  served as chair of the Friends' Membership Committee for more than  a decade. In addition, she is an active member of the Garden Club of  the UCSC Women's Club, a member and former board member of the  Friends of the UCSC Farm and Garden, and a member of the  Arboretum Associates.

"It's a real pleasure to see Ruth receive this well-deserved  recognition," said University Librarian Allan Dyson. "Ruth is a  devoted volunteer who has served the Friends of the UCSC Library in  one capacity or another for more years than either she or I would  care to remember."
