SANTA CRUZ, CA--On Thursday, February 16, renowned UC Santa Cruz  astronomer Sandra Faber will take listeners on a journey to the  Hubble Space Telescope, as she recounts personal experiences of the  instrument's design, vision problems, and the mission to repair it.  Her talk, entitled "The Hubble Space Telescope: Back From the Dead,"  will begin at 7:30 p.m. at the Veteran's Memorial Building, 846 Front  Street, Santa Cruz. Admission is free.

Faber, a member of Space Telescope's wide field planetary  camera team, has been with the project from its start. She was one  of three astronomers who initially diagnosed the flaw in the  telescope's main mirror, and she served on the panel that directed  repairs. Following the panel's recommendation, astronauts installed  a series of corrective lenses in December 1993, restoring the  Hubble's focus.

During her lecture, Faber plans to give an eyewitness account  of the telescope project and its major astronomical contributions,  explain how the Hubble got into trouble, and show slides of  astronomical objects both before and after the repair mission. "The  new photos are fantastic," she says. "It's like night and day."

Faber is a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC  and an astronomer at UCO/Lick Observatory. She is a member of both  the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts  and Sciences. She joined the UCSC faculty in 1972.

Seats at Faber's lecture will be available on a first-come,  first-served basis only. The Friends of the UCSC Library and the  Friends of the Santa Cruz Public Library are cosponsoring the event.  For more information, call Margaret Gordon at the UCSC Library,  459-4211.
