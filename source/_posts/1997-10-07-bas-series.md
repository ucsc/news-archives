From the accounting office to the police department, Business and Administrative Services (BAS) units provide a wealth of services to the campus community. A new series of lunch-time forums will give students, faculty, and staff an opportunity to learn about these services. At "Bag-It With BAS," the heads of BAS units will discuss what their units do for the campus and answer questions from those attending.

The first forum will take place Wednesday, October 9, at the Porter Fireside Lounge and will focus on disaster preparedness, since October is Disaster Preparedness Month. It will feature Police Chief Jan Tepper, Fire Chief Chuck Hernandez, and Ilse Kolbus, director of Environmental Health & Safety. BAS forums will take place from 12 to 1 P.M. throughout the year (dates and locations will be announced). Beverages will be provided. For more information, call Business and Administrative Services at ext. 3778.
