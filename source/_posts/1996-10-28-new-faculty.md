**Hirotaka Tamanoi**

Assistant Professor of Mathematics  

Hirotaka Tamanoi earned his B.S. and M.S. from the University of Tokyo and his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University, all in mathematics. He worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, the Max Planck Institute in Bonn, Germany, and the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques in Paris before coming to UCSC. Tamanoi studies topological and geometrical invariants of mathematical objects called spin manifolds. The idea comes from string theory in physics, which holds that elementary particles are tiny vibrating loops.   

**Frank Galuszka**

Professor of Art  

A critically acclaimed painter, Frank Galuszka's work has been featured in nearly two dozen solo exhibits, more than 70 group exhibitions, and is included in a number of public and corporate collections. He is interested in second-order cybernetics-a field focusing on issues of connectedness that include the observer. Currently chair of the Art Department, Galuszka was a visiting professor last year at UCSC. From 1974 to 1996, Galuszka was a faculty member at the University of the Arts at the College of Art and Design in Philadelphia. He is President of the American Society for Cybernetics and serves as a consultant on the subject for Dupont and the Yellow Springs Institute. Galuszka earned his B.F.A. and M.F.A. in painting from Temple University. To view a painting by Frank Galuszka access [http://www.ucsc.edu/oncampus/currents/96-10-28/newfacart.htm][5].
