title: New UC Santa Cruz Internship Program Works With Local Businesses

SANTA CRUZ, CA--In a unique partnership with its business neighbors, the  University of California, Santa Cruz, has created a new internship program  subsidizing wages for students in the local workforce.

A project of the university's Career Center, the Professions Training  Program matches companies with qualified students, pays part of the  students' wages, covers workers' compensation, and takes care of paperwork  for each paycheck. Interns are officially employed by UC Santa Cruz while  they work for the outside employer.

The program is looking for more businesses interested in hiring UCSC  interns.

"Employers get skilled, educated workers for a relatively low wage  and on a real level participate in developing the local workforce," said  Program Coordinator Melissa McClaren-Lighty. "The university gets an  opportunity to bridge the gap students face between school and the working  world. It's very much a partnership effort between the university and local  businesses."

Santa Cruz attorney Gary Thelander hired a UCSC senior as an intern  this summer under a pilot version of the Professions Training Program. His  intern, Shawntaviya Holmes, performed legal research, conducted  investigations, and participated in client interviews, Thelander said.

Having an intern he could rely upon helped Thelander fill a niche in his  office, he said. "Plus, there's a good feeling you get from letting someone  learn at your side."

In addition to law interns like Holmes, the program provides students  with skills in marketing, management, technology, finance, human  resources, and other fields. The students earn a minimum wage of $9 an hour  for their work, $4.50 of which is subsidized by UC Santa Cruz.

Interns may work a maximum of 15 hours per week during the school  year and up to 40 hours per week during the summer. Internships can last for  100 to 400 hours. McClaren-Lighty expects interns to do professional or  paraprofessional work, preferably on well-defined projects for which they  can take responsibility.

When a business requests a UCSC intern, the university culls the most  qualified applicants from its database of approximately 340 and sends a  selection of resumes and letters of recommendation to the potential  employer, McClaren-Lighty said. The employer may then conduct interviews  before deciding whether to hire an intern.

Career advisers help students prepare for the internship by reviewing  their resumes, discussing their goals, and teaching workplace skills.

"These are creative, highly motivated, career-oriented candidates that  the companies interview--we make sure of that," said McClaren-Lighty, who  hopes to place 25 students into internships this fall. "They bring the latest  knowledge of their field with them."

Peter Dorman spent his summer at Raytek Inc. As an engineering  assistant, he helped the Santa Cruz company develop a better system for  labeling the temperature gauges it manufactures. The job required that  Dorman analyze data about the current labeling system, find hardware and  software to fit the company's specifications, and help generate the  purchasing and service contract for the new system.

Dorman felt inspired knowing his work for Raytek was important to  the company's well-being. "That responsibility allowed me to have a lot of  pride in what I was doing," he said.

The program has already made several placements for the fall.  Starting early in the school year, two students will work in the computer  center and Life Lab at DeLaveaga Elementary School.  In Life Lab, students plant and design gardens to learn about biology,  ecology, and other subjects.

Another intern will develop a marketing plan and World Wide Web  pages for Spirit of Silk, a Santa Cruz-based producer of hand-dyed silk  pillows and scarves. Two additional interns will work for Coast Commercial  Bank in Santa Cruz--one in the area of corporate training and another on  special projects in association with the chief financial officer.
