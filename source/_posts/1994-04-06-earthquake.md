title: Earthquake Hazard In Southern California Is Widespread, According To Model That Combines Many Kinds Of Assessment

PASADENA, CA--Southern Californians have long lived in fear of "The  Big One." In recent years, however, scientific focus has shifted from  that one huge earthquake on the San Andreas Fault, as seismologists  have realized that smaller but potentially more hazardous faults  crisscross virtually the entire L.A. basin. The latest example ripped  Northridge in January: a magnitude 6.8 quake on an unknown fault far  underground.

Now, a model of seismic hazard from Parkfield to San Diego  quantifies that new reality. While the mighty San Andreas and other  big faults remain players, the model suggests that 40 percent of the  region's total earthquake motions could occur in widely scattered  areas away from those faults--and closer to many cities.

As a result, says model creator Steven Ward of the University  of California, Santa Cruz, "For most residents of southern California,  the lion's share of hazard from moderate earthquake shaking over a  30-year period derives from smaller, closer, more frequent quakes  of magnitude 5 to 7, rather than from large San Andreas ruptures,  whatever their likelihood."

Ward, a research geophysicist at UCSC's Institute of Tectonics,  will present his model on April 6 at a meeting of the Seismological  Society of America in Pasadena. An article on the model will appear  later this year in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of  America.

Ward's model differs from most previous attempts to define  seismic hazard in a large region. Most commonly, researchers use  records of past quakes and known rates of slip along major faults to  estimate when future earthquakes might strike. That works well for  areas where all the action happens on a few faults, but it fails for  southern California's complex patchwork. For a more complete  model, Ward blended two other ingredients into his stew:

Space geodesy, a relatively new and powerful way to find out  how quickly strain builds up in the earth's crust. Measurements using  both satellites and distant quasars reveal tiny motions in the  positions of many stations on the ground relative to each other. Ward  used such data compiled for the last ten years to map strain  throughout the entire region.

"Synthetic" seismicity. Ward developed a computer model of  the San Andreas and other faults. The model simulates thousands of  years of earthquake behavior, based on the physics of how stress  accumulates and releases in the earth. Its results: Quakes happen  less regularly than researchers have assumed, and they often break  several segments of a fault in a row.

Historical earthquake records and geological findings from the  field, together with predictions from the computer model, gave Ward  the constraints he needed to convert the geodetic motions into  estimates of the sizes, locations, and frequencies of quakes. To  assign those numbers to geographical areas, Ward used a map of 66  boxes spread across the landscape of southern California like a  crazy quilt. Some of the boxes straddle sections of famous faults,  but two-thirds of them cover areas with either many faults or  unknown faults.

"With this approach, we can estimate the seismic hazard in  each area even if we don't know exactly where the faults are," Ward  says. "The space geodesy is what is really new--it supplies  information where geology and seismology can't."

Ward displays the model's results as a series of maps, each of  which shows the likelihood of different types of hazard in southern  California. For instance, over the next 30 years virtually all of the  region has more than a 50-50 chance of feeling shaking at a  moderate level of 10 percent the force of gravity. Shaking twice as  strong is most likely to occur at Parkfield, near San Bernardino, and  northwest of Los Angeles from Ventura to San FernandoÂ­near the  site of the Northridge quake.

Another map shows that much stronger and more damaging  shaking--from three-tenths to half the force of gravity--has a  roughly 6 percent chance of occurring in most of the region during  the next 30 years. Those odds increase in the areas listed above.

The most powerful shaking in Ward's model does occur near the  San Andreas Fault and the San Jacinto Fault, which branches south  off the San Andreas near San Bernardino. However, such shaking is  much less likely to happen within 30 years, because large quakes on  those faults are rare. Indeed, when Ward removed all quakes greater  than magnitude 7 from his model, it made little difference--the  hazards for moderate shaking throughout most of the region stayed  largely the same.

Ward's maps show that the region's hazards are not uniform-- they vary markedly from place to place. "But most areas will not  escape eventual shaking," he says. "There are faults everywhere."

Ward notes that his model does not account for different soil  conditions. For instance, loose soil can amplify ground shaking,  dramatically increasing the hazard. In addition, he is updating his  model to include the most likely patterns of earthquake faulting in  each area. A "thrust" earthquake, such as the Northridge event, can  create more severe ground shaking than a "strike-slip" quake, where  the ground moves from side to side.
