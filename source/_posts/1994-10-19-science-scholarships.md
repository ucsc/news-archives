SANTA CRUZ, CA--Eleven science students at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, have received $5,000 scholarships from the  Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation. The  students were honored today (October 19) at a ceremony in San  Francisco.

Now in its 22nd year of awarding scholarships, the northern  California chapter of the ARCS Foundation awarded $501,000 to 80  students at 8 area universities for the 1994-95 academic year.  UCSC's winners--the largest number in any year to date--are as  follows:

Kenneth Chang (Bridgewater, NJ), a student in the Science  Communication Program, has studied physics and worked for one  summer as a science writer at the San Francisco Chronicle.

Thomas Geocaris (Hayward, CA) is pursuing a master's degree  in computer engineering. His current project involves developing an  image-acquisition system for a neural network.

Stephen Harris (St. Louis, MO) enrolled in the Science  Communication Program to expand upon his medical career. He is a  staff pediatrician at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center.

Robert Hoffman (Oxnard, CA) is nearing completion of his Ph.D.  in astronomy and astrophysics. He studies the creation of new  elements in supernovas, the giant explosions of stars.

Kirsten Lindstrom (Santa Cruz, CA) is working toward a  master's degree in marine sciences. For her thesis project, she is  conducting a genetic analysis of an unusual type of coral.

Lara Mahal (Chula Vista, CA), a senior in chemistry, has  interests in organic and inorganic chemistry and toxicology. She  plans to earn a Ph.D. in chemistry, then conduct research and teach.

Free Moini (Waldport, OR), a junior with a double major in  computer and information sciences and mathematics, is interested  in computer languages and computer architecture.

Barbara Robinson (Santa Barbara, CA) is in the master's  program in biology, with an emphasis on studying the immune  system. She will apply to M.D.-Ph.D. programs in the field.

Antonia Torreblanca (Davis, CA), a junior in biochemistry,  studied last year at the University of Chile and volunteered at a  Chilean hospital. She plans to attend medical school.

Christopher Woolston (Billings, MT) of the Science  Communication Program has spent summers in Oregon, Yellowstone,  and Antarctica. He has degrees in fish and wildlife and biology.

Corinna Wu (Schaumburg, IL) joined the Science Communication  Program with a master's degree in materials science and  engineering. She spent two summers working at NASA in Houston.

The ARCS Foundation was established in 1958 in Los Angeles.  It is now a national nonprofit organization providing support for top  college science students throughout the country.
