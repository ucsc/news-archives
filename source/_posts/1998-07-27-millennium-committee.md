The Millennium Committee, appointed by Chancellor Greenwood a year ago to "articulate key principles that will serve as touchstones for all campus planning into the 21st century," has submitted its advisory report to the chancellor.

Professor Gail Hershatter and Associate Vice Chancellor Marc Mangel served as the committee's cochairs. They were joined on the committee by other faculty members as well as staff, student, and UCSC Foundation representatives.
