**Regional Institutions Team Up To Offer A Weekend Of Fun And Activity For High School Competitors**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Fifty high school students from central and northern  California will converge on UC Santa Cruz on Saturday, February 7, for the  Northern California regional Ocean Sciences Bowl. This event, which is free  and open to the public, brings 10 teams of students together to test their  knowledge of the ocean as they field queries on the biology, chemistry,  geology, physics, history, and economics of the ocean and ocean-related  current events. The competition will run from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M.; all events  will take place in UCSC's Earth and Marine Sciences Building.

The winning team of the regional competition will receive an  expenses-paid trip to Washington, D.C., in April to compete in the first  National Ocean Sciences Bowl. The national champions will head to Lisbon,  Portugal, to observe the International Year of the Ocean at Expo '98.

"This event highlights the importance of the marine sciences, and it  gives UCSC an opportunity to showcase our role as a leading marine research  institution," said Dorris Welch, director of public education at UCSC's Long  Marine Laboratory, which is hosting the science bowl and a second day of  activities for the students. "We want to inspire the next generation of  scientists and encourage the public to become involved with our programs."

The Northern California competition is sponsored by the Consortium  for Oceanographic Research and Education (CORE) in partnership with the  National Marine Educators Association (NMEA). The UCSC Admissions Office  is cosponsoring the event, which is being hosted by the public education  program at Long Marine Lab. UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood will make  opening remarks at about 8:15 A.M. in room B206. Admiral James Watkins,  president of CORE, will attend the competition and awards ceremony at the  end of the day.

Each participating school (see list below) is sending a team of four  students and one alternate to the competition. The teams will tackle  multiple-choice and short-answer questions developed by a national panel of  marine educators, including Welch. The panel will draw their questions from  the scientific and technical disciplines used in studying the oceans, such as  physics, chemistry, geology, biology, and atmospheric science. Other  questions will concern the role of the oceans in economics, history, and  culture.

Schools had the option of incorporating training for the bowl into their  regular science curricula or establishing special after-school groups for  their teams. The ultimate goal is to increase public visibility and  understanding of the national investment in ocean-related research.

Following the competition, on Sunday, February 8, the high school  experts will attend a discussion with faculty from UCSC; California State  University, Monterey Bay; and community colleges. UCSC will offer a guided  tour of the campus led by current science undergraduates. At the end of the  day, the high school students will be offered a behind-the-scenes tour of  Long Marine Lab.

UCSC is one of 16 sites across the country where regional  competitions are being held, including West Coast sites such as the Scripps  Institution of Oceanography and the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.

Event officials, including judges and scorekeepers, are faculty,  researchers, marine managers, and docents from several Monterey Bay  institutions, including UC Santa Cruz, Moss Landing Marine Labs, the US Geological Survey, the Naval Post-Graduate School, Monterey  Bay National Marine Sanctuary, California State Parks, and Long Marine Lab.
