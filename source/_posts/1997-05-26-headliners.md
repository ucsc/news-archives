In preparation for an extended piece on bilingual education, a crew from the _Jim Lehrer News Hour_ was on campus last week to interview **Roland Tharp** at the offices of the Center for Research on Education, Diversity and Excellence. They also interviewed Tharp at Starlight Elementary School in Watsonville and filmed a CREDE working session with **Peggy Estrada,** **Stephanie Dalton, Sybil Kline, Barry Rutherford,** and graduate students.

The _Los Angeles Times_ tapped sociologist **Herman Gray** for comment on the debate over the television show _Martin,_ which aired its final episode recently. The show, which was one of the most popular network shows among African Americans, was the target of intense criticism from some African American leaders, who denounced the humor as racially offensive and stereotypical.
