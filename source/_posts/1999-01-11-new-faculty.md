**Aída Walqui:** Assistant Professor of Education

Aída Walqui's primary interests are bilingual education and the professional development of teachers. Her forthcoming book, "Access and Engagement: Effective Schooling for Immigrant Students at the Secondary Level," presents her research on four schools across the country that represent "pockets of excellence" in bilingual education. A former teacher, Walqui's current research seeks to identify the features of effective professional development programs and how they vary across different contexts. She earned her Ph.D. in education from Stanford University. She also has an M.S. in sociolinguistics from Georgetown University, a B.A. in English literature from Connecticut College, and a B.A. in literature from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Lima.
