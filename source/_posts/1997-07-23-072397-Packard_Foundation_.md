## Packard Foundation Supports UC Santa Cruz Arboretum With $309,757 Grant

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The David and Lucile Packard Foundation of Los  Altos has granted $309,757 to the Arboretum at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, home to some of the world's finest  collections of plants from the Southern Hemisphere and California.

The Packard Foundation will award the grant over the next  three years to help the Arboretum sustain its activities at a time  when state funding sources are dwindling. During the grant period,  Arboretum staff will work with the Packard Foundation's  Organizational Effectiveness Program to devise plans for the  Arboretum's long-term financial self-sufficiency.

"This generous support from the Packard Foundation will help  UCSC preserve one of its most remarkable assets," said Thomas  Vani, vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services at  UCSC. "We feel confident that the Arboretum will thrive in the  coming years, and we look forward to working with the Packard  Foundation to help us create a plan to achieve that goal."

The Arboretum will seek new funding sources from  memberships, private donations, expanded gift and plant sales, fees  for classes and other on-site events, and major contributions to help  build a permanent endowment, Vani said.

The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, created in 1964,  supports and encourages organizations that depend on private  funding and volunteer leadership. It awards grants to programs in  the arts, community, marine biology, environment, population,  education, and children's health.

The Packard Foundation's support of programs at UCSC now  totals more than $3.3 million, noted Dan Aldrich, assistant  chancellor for University Advancement. In addition to the Arboretum,  the foundation's largest gifts to UCSC have bolstered the Institute  of Marine Sciences, the planned Marine Discovery Center at Long  Marine Laboratory, Shakespeare Santa Cruz, and the research of  three consecutive recipients of the foundation's $500,000  fellowships in science and engineering.

"We are very fortunate to have this latest interest and support  from the Packard Foundation as UCSC strives to serve the people of  the Monterey Bay region and the state with this world-renowned  botanical treasure," Aldrich said.

The UCSC Arboretum, established on rough pastures in 1967,  spreads over 130 acres between the campus's main and west  entrances. It features the largest display of Australian plants  outside of that country, plus major collections from New Zealand  and South Africa. California natives and plants from the Pacific Rim  abound as well. Horticulturists have focused on drought-tolerant and  pest-resistant flowers, shrubs, and trees that fare well in  California's special climate.

In addition to its striking collections, the Arboretum has  become an important source of new plants for the state's  horticultural industry and for private gardeners. It also plays a key  role in preserving and cultivating endangered plants.

Professor Ray T. Collett, the Arboretum's director since its  inception, has nurtured the site with a small, dedicated staff of  managers and horticulturists. Collett has received several recent  honors recognizing his work, including the California Horticultural  Society's Annual Award for 1997 and the California Association of  Nurserymen's 1997 Research Award.

"A grant of this size is most helpful to the Arboretum," said  Collett. "It is especially significant to us that an organization the  caliber of the Packard Foundation has recognized our efforts with  this assistance."

Visitors are welcome at the Arboretum daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., year-round. The sights and smells change with the seasons,  but a typical visitor might encounter:

\-- Flowering plants of all shapes and colors, from enormous  proteas to bushy red grevilleas.

\-- Spectacular hummingbird acrobatics, especially in the  spring.

\-- A fragrant grove with nearly 100 different species of  eucalyptus trees.

\-- Norrie's Gifts, a unique shop featuring plants and seasonal  arts and crafts.

\-- The Jean and Bill Lane Horticultural Library, with extensive  holdings of books and magazines. (The library is open from 1 to 4 p.m.  Wednesday through Sunday.)

Visitors also may join the Arboretum Associates, a community  support group that sponsors plant sales, slide shows, workshops,  classes, and other programs.

Tours for schools and groups are available by appointment. For  more information, call the Arboretum at (408) 427-2998.
