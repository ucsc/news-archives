SANTA CRUZ, CA--City on a Hill Press, a weekly newspaper produced  by students at the University of California, Santa Cruz, received 23  awards in recent national and statewide journalism competitions,  including honors for overall design, photography, news and feature  writing, and advertising design.

The paper received twenty Gold Circle Awards from the  Columbia Scholastic Press Association (CSPA) and three awards  from the California Intercollegiate Press Assocation. The awards  honor work published in 1993.

"This staff has worked really hard to try to push the limits of  what we're doing," said Steve Palopoli, editor-in-chief for the  1993-94 academic year. "The design staff has been really sharp,  always asking themselves 'What can we do that people don't expect  us to do?,' and the writing staff has also been doing that. People  have just really been pushing it. I had a sense things were going  well, and this confirmed that."
