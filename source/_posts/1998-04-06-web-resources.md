**Human Resources Posts New Web Pages**

HR staff have been busy spinning new Web pages and improving old ones. The result is that a wide range of useful information on UCSC and UC Human Resources is now available to Web users.

Along with expanding and reorganizing the existing Staff Human Resources Web page, new pages have been added under the general heading of Human Resources.

Visit the [Human Resources pages][3] for information on academic and staff human resources, labor relations, benefits, EEO/AA and diversity education, sexual harassment/Title IX, the payroll personnel system, and training and development.

**Where To Go For Updates On Labor Contract And Bargaining Issues**

The latest information on bargaining and labor issues can be found at the Labor Relations Office's Web site. The Labor Relations Office administers systemwide staff and academic union contracts and consults with the Office of the President on establishing and reviewing personnel policies and programs.

Along with information on the UCSC Office of Labor Relations, the pages provide links to UC pages dealing with systemwide issues.
