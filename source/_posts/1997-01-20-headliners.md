Psychologist **Anthony Pratkanis** began the new year with an interview by _Investor's Business Daily._

**Daniel Press** of environmental studies had a long talk recently with Daniel Jordan on KUSP Radio, covering Press's EPA-funded project on open space in California and other pressing environmental topics.

_Science_ magazine recently published a letter by linguist **Geoffrey K. Pullum.** In his letter, Pullum discusses some inaccuracies in an article in _Science_ about tracing language family trees, noting that it is not necessary to have ancient manuscripts in languages in order to study their history; conclusions about ancient language families can be reached through comparison of the spoken forms of modern languages.

The _San Jose Mercury News_ lauded **Carter Wilson** of community studies, whose book about AIDS in the Yucatan, _Hidden in the Blood,_ earned an award from the Society of Gay and Lesbian Anthropologists.

Composer **David Cope's** computer program EMI, which can compose music, was the focus of yet another story. This one, which first appeared in the _Kansas City Star_ and was recently picked up by the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel,_ notes that January 13, 1997, is the birth date of HAL, Arthur Clarke's computer-with-an-attitude from the book and movie _2001: A Space Odyssey._ The author's premise is that computer programs have a long way to go before obtaining the sophistication of Clarke's "big lug of a circuit board"--and yet there are some that are coming close, Cope's among them.

Anthro lab manager **Josh Snodgrass** was profiled in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ about his forensic work with a human-rights group in Croatia.
