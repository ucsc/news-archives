**Three-week institute at UC Santa Cruz to run July 10-27**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Balancing the checkbook. Remodeling the house.  Playing the stock market. Understanding science and technology. It  all adds up to a lot of math, and woe to those who can't keep up. But  thanks to teachers from the Monterey Bay Area Mathematics Project,  area students are better equipped to handle these challenges--and  less intimidated by a subject that others dread.

Now in its tenth year, the project helps teachers bring math to  life for their charges. Those who enroll are encouraged to toss their  dull lessons and rote exercises in favor of hands-on activities that  excite students and prompt them to realize that math is a vital part  of their world. To date, more than 200 teachers from the counties of  Monterey, San Benito, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz have completed  the project, which features a three-week summer institute at UC  Santa Cruz.

"Teachers need to help students develop their thinking and  problem-solving skills, not just do bookkeeping and accounting,"  says Edward Migliore, the project's lead instructor and a lecturer in  mathematics at both UCSC and Monterey Peninsula College. "By the  end of each institute, we see that teachers come away with a sense  of confidence to take back to the classroom, instead of fear and  aversion."

This year, 34 teachers of students in grades K-8 will attend  the institute, set for July 10-27. They also will participate in  follow-up events during the year. A team of instructors from area  schools and community colleges--including veterans of previous  institutes--will join Migliore to teach dynamic new approaches to  working with numbers, solving problems, logic, probability and  statistics, and other topics. Each day, teachers will gather by grade  level to discuss how to use the lessons in their classrooms and to  swap ideas on getting the most out of limited time and supplies.

Bruce Cooperstein and Solomon Friedberg, professors of  mathematics at UCSC, are the project's coprincipal investigators. It  is part of the California Mathematics Project, which sponsors  institutes on numerous UC and California State University campuses.

Editor's note: Please see the attached page for a list of teachers  from schools in your area. The summer institute runs from 8:30 a.m.  to 4 p.m. on Monday through Thursday of each week at the Crown  College Library, UCSC campus. To arrange a visit, call (408) 459- 4369 or (408) 459-2495.
