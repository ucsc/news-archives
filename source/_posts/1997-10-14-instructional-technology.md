title: Instructional Technology Offers New Teaching Tools At UC Santa Cruz

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Newsgroups. Online tutorials. The World Wide Web.  A few years ago, not one of these tools was widely available to  university instructors. Now, with high-tech in full bloom,  enterprising educators are finding ways to enhance their students'  experiences, both in and out of the classroom.

Few campuses are moving ahead as quickly as UC Santa Cruz to  create a virtual environment within which these instructional  changes are possible. Teams of faculty, students, and staff are  working to bring more of their colleagues online in ways that  complement, rather than replace, UCSC's honored approaches toward  liberal arts education.

"Everyone knows the intensity with which we developed the  Financial Information System," said Fred Siff, associate vice  chancellor for Communications and Technology Services. "It's time  to do the same thing with instructional technology. In a community  as creative as the one in which we work, people will learn to use  these tools to tremendous advantage if they are accessible to  everyone."

Added James Willis, instructional laboratory coordinator for  the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department: "We have an incoming  generation of students for whom the first mouse they knew was a  computer mouse. The technical literacy and expectations of these  students are likely to challenge the traditional format of textbook  to blackboard to exam."

Already, many instructors are placing course materials on the  World Wide Web and creating interactive forums for their students,  expanding their learning beyond a classroom's walls. Virtual field  trips and links to useful resources give students the flexibility to  make their classes far richer. Further, communication between  students and instructors and among students becomes easier,  especially for large classes.

This ramping up of instructional technology efforts at UCSC is  a direct result of a systemwide conference on the topic, held last  spring. Officials from UC's Office of the President (UCOP) urged  attendees to take action toward encouraging faculty to augment  their teaching methods with new tools. UCOP then provided $4 million in funding for campuses to use this year for instructional  technology improvements. UCSC will receive $257,000 from that  pool.

A group under the aegis of the campus Instructional Technology  Policy Council (ITPC) will recommend using the UCOP funds to  increase student access to instructional technology tools, mainly  via these actions: setting up more workstations, making software  available on a "check out" basis over the network, improving  technical support, and buying subscriptions to electronic journals  and databases.

Some of the funds also will subsidize a new agreement with an  off-campus Internet Service Provider to give students inexpensive  ($30 per quarter), unlimited access to e-mail and the Internet. Such  a service will decrease reliance on the campus modem pool, which  limits access during prime hours. Although the program is now in a  pilot phase, Siff anticipates heavy student demand.

Instructional technology working groups on campus envision  other specific programs, already in place or under development. They  include:
* The "Teaching Technology Toolkit," an online resource that  repackages available tools into formats easy for faculty members to  use. For instance, an instructor can go to this site to create a course  Web page, obtain e-mail addresses for all students registered in the  class, make a mailing-list alias, and set up newsgroups for student  dialogue.
* An "online literacy course" for first-year students, which  debuted last week in a voluntary alpha test for students in the  Cowell College core course. The course, a "UCSC Trail to the  Internet," guides students at their own pace through Web browsing,  e-mail, online library resources, and newsgroups. At the end,  successful participants get "passes" stating they are UCSC network  citizens. Siff hopes the literacy course will be in place next year for all  students. "Our goal is to create a campus baseline of computer  literacy for all students, a baseline that faculty can rely upon in  their classes," he said. "I believe this is a necessary precondition for  academic life and student life, and for the integrated environment  we are trying to create."
* Online placement exams for incoming students, to replace  Scantron exams that can take days to analyze. Willis, who is  directing this initiative, stated that in trials the students were  much more satisfied with getting results virtually instantly. The  Registrar's Office and ITPC still need to work on ways to  authenticate these results in student records for departments to  use, Willis said.

Willis and his colleagues also are working on "modular  tutorials" that students could take regularly to gauge their grasp of  recent lessons presented in lecture. Instructors could see the group  results of these tutorials, providing guidance on which concepts to  review in subsequent lessons.

Both Siff and Willis emphasized that neither ITPC nor the  campus are mandating that faculty incorporate some, or any, of  these tools. "It is not true that the best way to teach in the 1990s is  to put everything on the World Wide Web and communicate primarily  by e-mail," Siff said. "We need to figure out how to make these new  tools work best within the framework of UCSC's traditional values.  But we cannot engage in that discussion intelligently without having  the tools in place and widely available."
