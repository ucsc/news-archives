title: 1997-98 A Record-breaking Year For UCSC Fund-raising

Just under $18 million in private gift and grant support was received by UCSC during the fiscal year ending June 30. The total is the highest in the campus's 33-year history, according to University Advancement.

The campus raised $17.9 million in the 1997-98 year; the previous private-sector fund-raising high was $13.5 million, raised in the 1996-97 academic year.

Along with establishing another record-breaking year for fund-raising, University Advancement expanded substantially during the 1997-98 academic year as five new program directors were hired.

"This has been a banner year for us not only in terms of gift support but also in building a strong foundation upon which further increases in private gift support can occur," said Daniel G. Aldrich III, assistant chancellor for University Advancement. "Among the many significant efforts this year was that of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation and its many volunteers who worked so hard to raise the necessary funding for the construction of the new Marine Discovery Center. We are extremely grateful for their efforts and for the generosity of the tens of thousands of donors who are committed to supporting the educational experience at UC Santa Cruz."

New records were set by a number of UCSC's fund-raising programs. Annual Fund contributions--primarily consisting of annual gifts from alumni and parents and matching funds from corporations--totaled more than $1.2 million, $892,000 of which was raised by students through telephone calls--another new record.

Additionally, in honor of its 20-year reunion, the campus's class of '78 donated $40,712 toward a scholarship program for students with financial need--the largest gift ever made by a UCSC alumni class. The $40,000 gift adds to the UCSC Alumni Association Scholarship Fund, which awarded ten $2,500 scholarships this academic year. The gift and others brings this endowed scholarship fund to slightly more than $500,000, halfway to the Alumni Association's goal of $1 million. Class gifts to provide scholarships or build endowments have been a tradition since UCSC began hosting 20-year reunions nearly a decade ago.

The bulk of funding this year came from foundations (41 percent) and individuals, including alumni and parents (40 percent). Twelve percent of support came from the business sector. Other sources included community organizations, trusts and bequests, and campus organizations.

The record-breaking year was supported by growth within University Advancement, the unit responsible for overseeing fund-raising efforts on campus. "We are delighted to have our fund-raising supported by our new staff," said Nancy Loshkajian, executive director of development. "Their efforts will further our overall mission to provide quality education for our students and to establish endowments and other permanent funding that help ensure the future of UCSC."

The new directors are Linda Getting, director of development for the Jack Baskin School of Engineering, a new position; Margaret Gordon, development officer for the University Library; Philip Stevens, director of development for the Humanities Division; Adrienne Harrell, in the new position of director of development for student affairs and the colleges; and Maria Kerschen, director of Advancement Services.

Major private gifts or grants received on campus during the past year included:
* $5 million from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation to support construction of the Institute of Marine Sciences' new Center for Ocean Health
* $2 million from an anonymous donor to support the construction of the Marine Discovery Center at Long Marine Laboratory
* $1 million from a private foundation, half of which will establish a fellowship in astronomy and astrophysics for Associate Professor Dennis Zaritsky and half of which will support new construction for the Marine Discovery Center
* Library Subject Endowments this year reached $1 million in value, thanks to the generosity of a number of benefactors who have established in all 23 endowments in a range of subjects from horticulture to Jewish studies to the Pacific Rim
* $500,000 to the UCSC Arboretum from Elspeth Bobbs and $250,000 from Barbara Shields to establish operating endowments
* Artwork by deceased San Francisco painter Charles Griffin Farr valued at $380,000 to the Sesnon Art Gallery. An additional $250,000 from Farr's estate will support construction of a new university art gallery.
* A donation of works by the late photographer Morley Baer from his widow Frances Baer valued at $500,000. The works will be housed in Special Collections, a unit of the University Library.
* A $400,000 challenge grant from the Kresge Foundation for construction on the Marine Discovery Center
* A $287,000 gift from the Walter S. Johnson Foundation to the Education Department
