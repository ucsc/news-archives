**Public Performances Will Be Offered Beginning This Month**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--On January 6, after nearly a decade of careful planning, the  University of California, Santa Cruz, offered its first classes in the new  Music Center. Neighboring the Performing Arts and Baskin Visual Arts  complexes, the $21 million center expands a cluster of arts facilities  located above the Great Meadow. The new facility offers a number of superb  performance venues as well as classrooms and teaching studios outfitted  with state-of-the-art equipment.

The facility was eagerly anticipated by the Music Department, which  has experienced years of steady enrollment increases and long ago outgrew  its designated space in the Performing Arts complex. The new center  provides 13 teaching studios, 20 practice rooms, 5 classrooms, an ensemble  rehearsal room, a music library, a percussion studio, and office space. The  centerpiece of the complex is a 396-seat Recital Hall.

The acoustic design and capabilities of the new Music Center are  considered to be among the best of any university music facility in the  country. Additionally, students are learning in classrooms linked by advanced  audiovisual technology and digital audio, video, and recording systems.

A series of inaugural concerts is planned throughout the spring,  culminating in a gala concert and dedication ceremony--as well as the  inauguration of Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood--on May 23. During the winter  quarter many exceptional concerts will also be offered (see schedule below).

The winter quarter will be a time for fine-tuning and refining the  acoustic features of the new performance venues. As dean of the arts Edward  Houghton notes, "The acoustical quality of the various spaces, even at this  early point, is very good to extraordinary. We now begin the process of fine- tuning the spaces and using the acoustically variable features to achieve the  very best sound characteristics for specific needs."

Along with providing exceptional facilities for students and faculty,  the new Music Center will be an outstanding venue for audiences.
