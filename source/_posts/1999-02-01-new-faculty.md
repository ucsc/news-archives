**Julie Lockwood:** Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies

Julie Lockwood is a conservation biologist interested in ecological communities. Her work on birds focuses on how humans have impacted the movement and establishment of exotic species around the world, looking at the interplay of transportation and extinction. Lockwood is an expert on the Cape Sable seaside-sparrow, an endangered subspecies that lives in Everglades National Park in Florida. She is coediting a book that explores the processes through which nonnative birds and plants are being spread around the globe, contributing to "biological homogenization." She earned her Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Tennessee, where she did postdoctoral work before coming to UCSC. She earned her B.S. and M.S. in biology from Georgia Southern University.
