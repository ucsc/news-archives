## UCSC Academic Senate Honors Professor Emeritus Joseph Bunnet With Dean Mchenry Award For Distinguished Leadership

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California, Santa Cruz, has honored Joseph Bunnett, professor emeritus of chemistry and biochemistry, with the Dean McHenry Award for Distinguished Leadership in the Academic Senate. In conjunction with this award, Bunnett was also nominated for the UC-systemwide Oliver Johnson Award for Distinguished Leadership in the Academic Senate.

Bunnett was a founding member of the UCSC campus, arriving in 1966 and serving as chair of the Chemistry Department. In selecting him for the Dean McHenry Award, an Academic Senate committee noted that Bunnett had succeeded brilliantly in areas crucial to the establishment of a new campus: department-building, teaching and related concerns with undergraduates, prominence in his profession, and service to the Academic Senate and the larger community.

The committee wrote that "Bunnett has been a driving force in the invention of the Santa Cruz campus. Much of his influence in shaping our campus institutions has been exercised through his Senate service. With his deep knowledge of the bylaws and parliamentary procedure he has enhanced the effectiveness of the Santa Cruz Senate and encouraged a generation of faculty to participate in the work of the Academic Senate."

Bunnett is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has received numerous awards in recognition of his research accomplishments. Most recently, he was awarded the James Flack Norris Award in Physical Organic Chemistry (1992), one of the highest honors a physical organic chemist can receive from the American Chemical Society.

Bunnett retired in 1991, but he continues an active program of research. He also assumed additional responsibilities when he retired, serving as chair of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemists (IUPAC) Task Force on Scientific Aspects of the Destruction of Chemical Warfare Agents. In 1995, he became, and continues to serve as, chairman of the corresponding IUPAC Committee on Chemical Weapons Destruction. Meanwhile, he continued to serve the Academic Senate faculty as chair of the Committee on Emeriti Relations until this year.
