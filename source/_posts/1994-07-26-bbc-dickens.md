SANTA CRUZ--A collaborative project between the British Broadcasting  Corporation (BBC) and the Dickens Project at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, gets under way the week of July 31 when Angie Mason, the  head of BBC's Educational Developments division, will be on campus with a  film crew interviewing world-renowned Dickens scholars.

The BBC and the Dickens Project are joining in partnership to produce  an educational resource kit on Hard Times and Martin Chuzzlewit--two  novels by Charles Dickens. The kit will be produced as a companion piece to  BBC adaptations of the two works (one starring Alan Bates) that will air in  the U.S. on Mobil Masterpiece Theatre in early 1995. They will be presented  on PBS by WGBH in Boston.

The resource kit consists of a video, an audiocassette, a workbook,  and a viewer's guide. This is the BBC's second collaboration of this type.  The first was in early 1994 with the British Film Institute for the  BBC/WGBH co-production of George Eliot's Middlemarch. Materials are  produced by BBC Education, a division of BBC and a major producer of  educational materials and programs distributed worldwide.

The Dickens Project, founded in 1981, is an international consortium  of faculty and graduate students headquartered at UCSC. The home of an  extensive library and archive on Dickens, the project promotes  collaborative research and produces curricular materials for use in  teaching Dickens.

Mason will work with Dickens Project director John Jordan and  Dickens Project founding director Murray Baumgarten, both faculty  members at UCSC. Her visit coincides with the fourteenth annual Dickens  Universe--a conference running August 1-7 that, coincidentally, is  focusing on Hard Times. The conference will bring more than 250 people  together, including eminent Dickens scholars from around the world.
