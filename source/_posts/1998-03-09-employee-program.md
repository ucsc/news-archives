title: Employees May Find Help Through The Employee Assistance Program
author: Barbara McKenna

The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is a confidential counseling program for UC faculty and staff. The service provides prepaid counseling services to those facing personal and work-related problems.

Managers, supervisors, and human resources representatives should be aware, particularly, of two services offered through EAP:

* **Management consultations:** Those with concerns about employees who are experiencing personal or job-performance problems may speak with counseling consultants to discuss the situation and options for dealing with and helping an employee. Consultants can help clarify issues, coach the supervisor in various approaches, and make referrals.
* **Suggested self-referral:** If an employee requests help in dealing with a problem or concern, supervisors may refer him or her to the EAP. Employees with a known personal problem that has not yet affected job performance may also be referred to the EAP.

All EAP services are provided through Managed Health Network and are confidential. For more information or to access services, contact Managed Health Network directly at (408) 253-8600. For general information on EAP, contact Julie Putnam, Benefits and Employment manager, at (408) 459-4996.
