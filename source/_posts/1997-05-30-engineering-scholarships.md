SANTA CRUZ, CA--David S. Lee, chairman of CMC Industries of Santa  Clara and a member of the University of California Board of Regents,  has pledged $100,000 to establish an endowed scholarship fund for  the new Jack Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.

Annual income from the Regent David S. Lee Scholarship Fund  will support one or more undergraduate students in the School of  Engineering starting in the fall of 1998. UCSC's Office of Financial  Aid and Patrick Mantey, dean designate of the School of Engineering,  will choose recipients on the basis of financial need.

"I am very pleased that UC Santa Cruz has established its  School of Engineering," said Lee. "As the closest UC campus to  Silicon Valley, Santa Cruz can play a key role in helping us fill the  shortage of trained engineers from institutions in the Bay Area."

Lee recalled that he came to the U.S. in 1956 with $600 in his  pocket and was unable to afford the out-of-state fees required to  attend UC. His scholarship fund, he hopes, will help alleviate such  situations for future students. "An education in engineering pays  back many times over, both in terms of personal earning power and  in keeping California competitive in the high-tech market," he said.  "The scholarship fund is my way of helping qualified students attain  that education."

Lee said he will augment the fund with future donations. He  also plans to contribute digital communications equipment to the  campus.

"I greatly appreciate Regent Lee's generosity," said UCSC  Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, who announced the scholarship fund  last week. "His wonderful gift sets an example of the kind of  community partnership that UC Santa Cruz needs now to realize the  full promise of the Jack Baskin School of Engineering. Regent Lee's  commitment means that more students will have access to UCSC's  21st century engineering programs. That is great news for those  students, and it also is very good news for the future economy of  this region, the state, and the nation."

Governor Pete Wilson appointed Lee to a 12-year term on the  Board of Regents in 1994. His company, CMC Industries,  manufactures telecommunications systems and related equipment.  CMC Industries employs 1,100 people and has annual sales exceeding  $200 million.

Two of Lee's three children are alumni of UC Santa Cruz. Eric Chih-Yen Lee received his B.A. in psychology in 1988, while  Gloria Chih-Ping Lee earned her B.A. in economics in 1990.
