**First Day Of Instruction Is Thursday, October 1**

The first day of classes in the 1998-99 school  year at UC Santa Cruz is Thursday, October 1. Students, however,  began moving into on-campus housing at UCSC on Friday,  September 25.

Here are some facts and figures about this year's student body, what the campus is doing to house students, and the new academic programs the campus is offering:

** Enrollment: **
* UCSC is expecting an opening-day enrollment of  approximately 10,850 students, 212 more students than were  officially enrolled last fall (10,638). (Enrollment totals become  official following the third week of instruction.) Of the 10,850  students, approximately 9,800 are expected to be undergraduates;  1,050, enrolled in graduate studies.
* Of the undergraduates expected to enroll, approximately  3,250 will be new students (freshmen and transfer students).  These 3,250 new undergraduates were admitted from among  17,400 applicants for undergraduate admission.

** Profile of New Freshmen: **
* Approximately 2,400 of the 3,250 new undergraduates  expected will be freshmen.
* Of those 2,400, approximately 500--a 24 percent increase  over last year's freshman class--will be from ethnic groups  underrepresented in the University of California: African  American, Chicano, Filipino, American Indian, and Latino. In  addition, approximately 400 of this year's expected freshmen  identified themselves as Asian/Asian American or  Filipino/Filipino American, compared to 350 last fall; although not  underrepresented in the UC system, these ethnicities are  underrepresented at UCSC.
* The two most popular majors among freshmen who have  already declared are psychology (183) and biology (171). The Jack  Baskin School of Engineering, beginning its second fall, attracted  262 freshmen who declared in the following majors: computer  science (158), computer engineering (72), and electrical  engineering (32).
* Nearly one-half (43 percent) of the expected freshmen come  from the San Francisco Bay Area (28.5 percent) and the Monterey  Bay-Silicon Valley (14.5 percent).
* The freshman class will include 34 Regents Scholars,  students whose academic achievements in high school qualified  them for the University of California's most prestigious  scholarship. (Ten other new students, transferring to UCSC this  fall, qualified for the same scholarship; among new and continuing  students, UCSC's student body now includes 145 Regents Scholars.)

** Housing UCSC Students: **
* To help offset a shortage of rental housing in the  surrounding community, UCSC has added 323 new "bed spaces" to  its on-campus housing total this year, exceeding the expected  increase of 212 in the student body. The additional spaces have  come from reconfiguring existing housing.
* This fall, UCSC will be providing on-campus housing space  for 5,112 of its students, or about 47 percent, by far the highest  percentage in the UC system.
* In addition, UCSC is breaking ground this fall on a new  apartment complex north of the College Nine and Ten Academic  Buildings that will house 280 undergraduates beginning in fall  1999.

** New Programs for UCSC Students: **
* The School of Engineering has teamed with the Social  Sciences Division to create a new major in information systems  management (ISM). The ISM major will begin admitting students  this fall. Developed jointly by the Computer Science and Economics  Departments, the new major is designed to provide students with  a combination of business, technical, and communications skills.
* This will be the first fall that UCSC has offered an  undergraduate degree in business management economics. The  program combines the strong analytic approach of economics with  the technical aspects of management. It emphasizes the use of  computing skills in the analysis of economic, statistical, and  financial data, as well as the development of important  communication skills.
* UCSC's film and video program recently attained  department status. Film and video, one of the campus's fastest  growing majors, had been affiliated with the Theater Arts  Department.
* Beginning this fall, UCSC students will be able to earn a  degree in German studies. Administered by the History  Department, the major emphasizes an interdisciplinary approach--encompassing existing academic offerings in literature, politics,  history of consciousness, philosophy, art history, women's studies,  and language studies.
