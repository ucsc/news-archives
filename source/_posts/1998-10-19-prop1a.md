California voters will weigh in on a $9.2 billion, kindergarten-university school-bond measure on November 3. Proposition 1A will provide funds for modernization of outdated infrastructure, for renovation of aging classroom and laboratory buildings, to help pay for capital improvements for earthquake and life safety, and for new construction to accommodate enrollment growth. The proposition would provide $6.7 billion to K-12 schools over a four-year period and $2.5 billion to the state's three segments of public higher education--the University of California, California State University, and California Community Colleges.
