author: Jennifer McNulty

In honor of Terence Freitas, the UCSC alumnus who was recently murdered in South America, an endowment is being established to support the research of undergraduate students in environmental studies.

Relatives and friends of the Freitas family have pledged $10,000 to create the fund.

The pledge comes from Michael and Patricia Gold and their three children, who were close friends of the Freitas family, and Freitas's grandparents, Dr. and Mrs. J. Joseph Shelley of Los Angeles. Terry Freitas was best man at the wedding of one of the Gold children, and one of the Gold's sons was Freitas's camp counselor.

The Terence Freitas Award in Environmental Studies will be based on need and merit, and preference will be given to undergraduate environmental studies students who are working with indigenous peoples in developing countries, said Christina Valentino, director of development for the Division of Social Sciences, who is working with the Gold and Freitas families to create the endowment.

Freitas, a biology and environmental studies major who graduated in 1997, was working to preserve the culture of the U'wa, an indigenous group in Colombia, when he was kidnapped on February 25. His body was found in Venezuela a few days later. Freitas had worked with the U'wa for five years and, according to friends, had received death threats in the past.

Others interested in contributing to the fund are encouraged to call Valentino at (831) 459-3857.
