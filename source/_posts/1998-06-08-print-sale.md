Someday these may go for 100 times as much, but right now the work of UCSC student printmakers can be had for a mere song.

Hundreds of original etchings, lithographs, woodcuts, and linocuts by current and former students will be on display and for sale, with prices ranging between $10 and $50. This year's sale takes place on Friday, June 12, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the Printmaking Studio, Room G-101, in the Baskin Visual Arts complex.

Proceeds benefit the artists and the printmaking program. For more information, call the Printmaking Studio at (408) 459-4285 or 459-2887.

Also on June 12, from noon to 4 p.m., the Art Department will host Open Studio, an exhibit featuring artwork in a range of media completed by students during the past quarter. Works will be on display in each studio/classroom at Baskin Visual Arts.

Included in this Open Studio will be paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, artist's books, and photographs. For more information about Open Studio, call (408) 459-2272.
