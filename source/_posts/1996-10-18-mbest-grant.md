SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California's Monterey Bay  Education, Science, and Technology (MBEST) Center at the former  Fort Ord military base will soon take another step toward recruiting  new educational and research tenants, thanks to a $1 million grant  from the Economic Development Administration of the U.S.  Department of Commerce.

The new arrivals will join tenants such as Systems West, a  satellite weather-technology company; UCSC Extension, which  offers classes in environmental remediation and other topics; and  the Pacific Cetacean Group, a nonprofit education and research  organization.

The grant, first announced on September 16 by White House  Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, was formally received this week by UC  Santa Cruz, lead campus for the MBEST Center. It was part of a $15 million Fort Ord redevelopment package from the Economic  Development Administration, including $13 million for facilities at  California State University, Monterey Bay, and $1 million to the Fort  Ord Reuse Authority for road improvements.

Most of the UCSC grant will allow the campus to plan and  construct a new building at the center's site, near the new Marina  Municipal Airport. The building will become the second permanent  MBEST facility.

"The announcement of this grant marks another forward step in  achieving the economic development and programmatic goals of the  UC MBEST Center," says Lora Lee Martin of UCSC, director of the  center. "We are pleased that the Economic Development  Administration provided this grant to build the first new facility on  University of California land at the former Fort Ord."

Depending on cost estimates and other planning issues, the  building will contain about 10,000 square feet of space for future  tenants and MBEST Center staff. Construction should begin by early  1998 and will last about eight months.

Several public agencies and private companies already have  expressed interest in moving to the MBEST Center or establishing  branches there to create a presence in the Monterey Bay region. The  center's staff will seek new tenants who have programmatic links  with at least one of the many institutions in the Monterey Bay  Research Crescent. The research and development goals of  prospective tenants are expected to complement one or more of  several regional research strengths: information technology,  biotechnology, multimedia, and environmental technology.

With this first physical expansion, MBEST organizers will  advance toward their long-term goal of creating a community of  innovative and forward-thinking researchers and educators. This  synergistic community, Martin and her colleagues envision, will help  to position the Monterey Bay region and central California  competitively in the global economy of the coming decades.

However, MBEST's overall mission extends far beyond the  boundaries of its real estate at Fort Ord and any walls that may  arise there. Rather, the MBEST Center is striving to build  collaborative interactions and strategic alliances among research  and educational institutions, private businesses, and policy makers  throughout the entire region in order to foster economic  development. At a pair of workshops organized this past summer by  UCSC, leaders from private and public sectors spoke of their hopes  that MBEST could indeed catalyze the region's potential in this way.

The MBEST Center has progressed markedly within the last  year on several other fronts. Most notably, two teams of consultants  have nearly completed work on three major planning projects: a  master plan for the Fort Ord site, which will provide a blueprint for  future development and land use; a business plan, which recommends  a functional structure and evaluates financial feasibility; and a  market analysis, which recommends actions for the region and  university to attract educational and research businesses. A  previous $1.2 million grant from the Economic Development  Administration has funded these projects and the work of MBEST  staff at UCSC.

MBEST's site at Fort Ord comprises about 1,100 acres of land  along Reservation Road, of which 436 acres are developable. The Fort  Ord Reuse Authority has projected that over the next few decades,  development at the MBEST Center will create the largest number of  new jobs of any reuse activity at the former base. Funding for future  buildings will come mainly from private sources.

As part of the MBEST project, the UC Regents recently  accepted about 600 acres of unique maritime chaparral into the UC  Natural Reserve System. Called the Fort Ord Reserve, this land is  adjacent to the developable MBEST property and the Marina Municipal  Airport.
