SANTA CRUZ, CA--Fun in the sun, fascinating science, and furry  seals and sea lions are among the many festive sights and sounds at  one of the most popular family events in Santa Cruz: Long Marine  Laboratory's annual open house.

This year's open house, the eighteenth, runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday, October 12. It will feature activities for ocean  enthusiasts of all ages, from adults who want to hear about the  latest research to kids who want to see and feel sea creatures.

Thousands of visitors attend each open house at the lab, which  overlooks Monterey Bay at the western edge of Santa Cruz.  Admission is free. Shuttle buses will bring people to the lab from a  parking area at Silicon Systems, 2300 Delaware Avenue.

Long Marine Lab, a marine-research facility operated by UC Santa Cruz, opened in 1978. Its scientists work to understand  Monterey Bay's unique environment and explore other issues in the  ocean sciences worldwide. The lab's education programs for  schoolchildren and the general public draw more than 30,000 guests  each year.

Highlights of the open house include the following:
* Viewing of the lab's marine mammals, including dolphins  and sea lions.
* Tours of the newly built California Department of Fish and  Game Oiled Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center.
* Talks, videos, and slide shows by researchers at UCSC's  Institute of Marine Sciences.
* Open research labs with microscopes, marine invertebrates,  and other critters.
* A "children's corner," touch tanks, and many other marine- oriented activities for kids.
* Live Afro-Cuban music by Charanga Nueve.
* Foods from local restaurants, including Carniglia's Seafood,  El Palomar, and Upper Crust Pizza & Pasta.

The event is accessible to those with disabilities; people  needing special arrangements should call the lab in advance.
