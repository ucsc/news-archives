UC academic leaders, administrative managers, and professional  staff in positions to influence or implement change are invited to "Innovation and Tradition: UC in the 21st Century," the 1999 University of California Management and Leadership Conference (UCML). The conference is hosted by UCSC this year in cooperation with the Office of the President. It will take place June 6, 7, and 8 at the San Jose Fairmont Hotel. On-site registration begins at noon on Sunday, June 6, and the conference ends at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, June 8.

Now in its fourth year, the UCML conference provides information to leaders and managers and gives them the chance to discuss potential responses to the issues facing them and the opportunity to build and develop skills. Individuals at all levels of the institution, including academic administrators, medical center staff, principal investigators, department chairs, deans, and others, will find topics of interest reflected in the plenary sessions, keynote panels, and breakout sessions.

Keynote speakers feature industry and governmental leaders, such as William Davidow, Ph.D. (author of _The Virtual Corporation_), San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales, and Eric Berg of the PricewaterhouseCoopers Technology Centre. University leaders such as President Richard Atkinson, Executive Vice President Wayne Kennedy, and UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood will provide the higher education perspective.

Highlights of the conference include a Sunday evening reception at the San Jose Museum of Art and a Monday evening dinner at the Tech Museum of Innovation.
