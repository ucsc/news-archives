Ocean policy leaders from around the country will come to Monterey June 11-12 for the first National Ocean Conference in 25 years. President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and several cabinet secretaries plan to attend.

Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood will serve on a panel focusing on Oceans and Commerce, one of four main areas to be addressed at the conference. The other panels are Ocean Environment and Health, Ocean Education, Exploration, and Research, and Oceans and Global Security.

The conference will have lasting regional effects, including new cooperative efforts among ocean research institutions.

While the conference is not a public event, the Monterey Bay community is planning a major ocean celebration during the conference. The Monterey Bay Ocean Consortium--a confederation of organizations around the bay, including UCSC--is sponsoring an Oceans Fair on Friday, June 12, in Custom House Plaza in Monterey. There will be marine science and technology exhibits from throughout the nation, environmental activities, food booths, and live music, including the Banana Slug String Band.

Leading off the events surrounding the Ocean Conference will be a groundbreaking ceremony for a new National Marine Fisheries Service facility adjacent to Long Marine Laboratory on Wednesday, June 10. The ceremony will be followed by a reception on campus at University House.
