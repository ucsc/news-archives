SANTA CRUZ--Economic uncertainty, changing societal needs, and  diminishing public confidence are major challenges facing America's  research universities. In a public lecture on November 2, UC Santa  Cruz Chancellor Karl S. Pister will describe the forces reshaping  higher education in this country--and discuss the changes American  universities must make if they are to continue to serve society in  the 21st century.

The lecture, "American Universities at a Crossroads," begins at  8 p.m. in the Performing Arts Concert Hall on the UCSC campus. The  talk, which is free and open to the public, will launch the campus's  1995-96 Inaugural Lecture series.

Growing cultural diversity, rapid technological advances, and  federal budget cuts in research are among the forces rapidly  transforming our institutions of higher learning, Chancellor Pister  says. "The nation's universities have a splendid record of service to  the people of this country, indeed, of the world," he says. "But the  challenge to adapt to new societal conditions is urgent, and we  cannot afford to fail."

Inaugural Lectures are presented to celebrate a UCSC faculty  member's promotion or appointment to the position of full professor.  Faculty members are invited to present a talk for general audiences  based on an area of current research or interest. Though his  affiliation with UCSC began four years ago, Chancellor Pister has  never given an Inaugural Lecture.

Before becoming UCSC chancellor in August 1991, Pister  served for ten years as dean of UC Berkeley's College of Engineering.  Pister earned his Ph.D. in theoretical and applied mechanics from the  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, after taking his  bachelor's and master's degrees at Berkeley. He returned to Berkeley  in 1952 to join the Department of Civil Engineering.

Inaugural Lectures are presented by UCSC Arts & Lectures and  supported by the Offices of the Chancellor and Executive Vice  Chancellor, the Council of Provosts, and University Affiliates.
