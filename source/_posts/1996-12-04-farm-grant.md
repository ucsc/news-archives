SANTA CRUZ, CA--Community-supported agriculture is one of the fastest- growing trends in agriculture these days. The way it works is simple:  Farmers set a price for a share of the year's produce, then recruit a group of  shareholders who receive a weekly box of freshly harvested vegetables and  fruits throughout the season. It's a partnership that allows farmers to plant  with a source of guaranteed income, and shareholders to get the freshest  goods for an average price of about $20 per week.

Two years ago, the Farm and Garden at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, launched its own community supported agriculture project  (CSA), recruiting shareholders from the campus community.

A new $16,000 grant from the Mary A. Crocker Trust will formally  establish the CSA project, enabling coordinators to create a formal CSA  Training and Demonstration program and expand their public education  activities. The grant will also support the final phase of expansion of the  CSA in 1998.

"This program offers benefits to several groups, including the  apprentices at the Farm who want the experience of running a CSA, and  shareholders who've supported the CSA from the beginning," says Margaret  FitzSimmons, an associate professor of environmental studies at UCSC and  acting director of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.  "We're filling an educational niche and providing a community service."

The grant will establish the CSA program as part of UCSC's  Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, a six-month training program in  organic farming and gardening, making the CSA the cornerstone of the Farm  and Garden's production and community-outreach efforts.

Specifically, the grant will fund:
* Development of a core set of CSA classes, field trips, and hands-on  training sessions for apprentices;
* Expansion of classes offered to area growers and the general public;
* A Field Day at the UCSC Farm for area growers, focusing on CSA  production and outreach;
* A permanent informational display board at the Farm's CSA  distribution barn.

"This grant enables us to create a comprehensive CSA training program  for apprentices and for farmers in the area," adds FitzSimmons. "We hope to  become a regional hub for CSA activity on the central coast."

The Mary A. Crocker Trust, which was established in 1889, supports  educational and environmental organizations primarily in the San Francisco  Bay Area. The trust has a special interest in supporting sustainable  agriculture.
