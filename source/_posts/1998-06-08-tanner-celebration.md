After nine years characterized by challenge and change, Michael Tanner leaves the executive vice chancellor's position at the end of June. The legacy of his leadership includes the expansion of UCSC's curriculum, the selection of a distinguished array of new faculty--more than half of the current UCSC faculty have been hired in the past nine years--the development of more open and efficient administrative processes, and the decentralization of budget responsibilities. And to help celebrate the culmination of nearly a decade's service in the position, Tanner joined classical guitarist William Coulter in a musical performance that highlighted a farewell dinner at University House on May 30.

A computer and information theory expert, Tanner is returning to full-time pursuit of his academic specialty, coding theory. Next year he will conduct research on high-speed error correction and engage with colleagues at MIT and Caltech as a visiting professor.

"Michael Tanner has offered yeoman's service to the university, helping us develop creative institutional responses to change and opportunity. For me personally, he's been a very good friend and a much-appreciated guide," said Chancellor Greenwood at the meeting of the Academic Senate on May 27.

In her comments at the same senate meeting, professor Helene Moglen, senate chair, thanked Tanner for his contributions to the campus. She noted that he has served "during difficult transitional years, in which difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions had to be made," and she concluded, "He leaves us far stronger than he found us."

Accepting the position as academic vice chancellor in 1989, Tanner was named executive vice chancellor after the arrival of Chancellor Karl Pister. In that role, he also ensured effective day-to-day operations of the campus, and, in the absence of the chancellor, he assumed urgent chancellorial responsibilities.

In the early 1990s, when the University of California experienced what many have characterized as the most severe reductions in state funding in its history, Tanner implemented a fair and decentralized budget process that placed responsibility for budget planning in the hands of the deans and other unit administrators. Social sciences dean Martin Chemers notes, "He has brought order out of chaos. The development of careful and comprehensive planning and budgeting principles has made it possible for us to understand our costs and respond appropriately to opportunities. This is a very great achievement."

Despite the stringent fiscal environment, during Tanner's leadership the campus has expanded its academic offerings. For example, art history, women's studies, and ocean sciences have been elevated to become departments. Tanner also provided initiative and support for numerous new and expanding majors, such as Latin American and Latino studies, environmental toxicology, electrical engineering, business management economics, the B.M. degree in music, and the Ph.D. in ocean sciences. Graduate degrees in electrical engineering and applied mathematics anticipated in the near future.

Private gifts helped provide the funding for many of the new programs, such as the gifts that supported the Jack Baskin School of Engineering and several endowed chairs in the arts, in the humanities, and in the social sciences. "Michael provided important guidance in helping mature our fund-raising efforts," recalls Assistant Chancellor Daniel Aldrich. "The Academic Advisory Board for Development, which he and former chancellor Pister helped create, has played a key role in establishing fund-raising priorities, goals, and processes for financing the advancement program."

To complement the burgeoning academic program, Tanner's leadership contributed greatly to the expansion of campus facilities. The completion of Social Sciences 1 and 2, the award-winning Science Library, the stunning music Recital Hall, the nearly completed Improvements to the Arts projects, and the completion of state-of-the-art videoconferencing facilities all provide tangible reminders of the service, initiative, and productivity of the Tanner years.

## 'Michael Tanner: The Song' (As sung by Dick Jensen, Nancy Loshkajian, and Paul Whitworth at celebration in Michael Tanner's honor)

### Part One: Tanner - The Youth

So bright was the babe Michael Tanner  
A prodigy, destined to win:   
I had talent galore, good looks and what's more   
A boyish and Pepsodent grin. I surpassed all my peers in the sandbox   
Wore a genuine Decoder Ring   
With which I could translate Ma Goose and   
At the drop of a hat I would sing  
At the top, of my lungs!   
I was fluent at birth in fourteen foreign tongues!

My brain was like magic, the kids found it tragic   
I thought in math-matics, alas!   
And I hit a nerve when I shattered the curve   
In my second grade calculus class.   
But, oh what is worse is I'd done it in verse   
At once both exquisite and somewhat perverse   
My pappy was quite happy   
My mamma just thought me divine   
They nurtured and praised me, so carefully raised me   
By methods approved at the time.

When twelve, I was still wearing knee pants,   
But to Stanford I went with no qualm   
It doesn't seem right but I was so bright   
They practically gave me the farm   
I learned all about engineering   
Applied myself both day and night   
But though it was invigorating   
I knew something wasn't quite right   
Packed my bag, and guitar   
And found what I'd missed with my feet in the Loire!

Oo la la! I soon cried with Eileen by my side   
My language skills reaching new heights,   
My time has been wasted, adventure untasted   
I'll live here the rest of my life   
I'll eat escargot and I'll call water "eau"  
And speak in a string of beaux jestes and bons mots   
Engineering's not endearing   
When compared with baguettes and berets   
And bohemian nights are replete with delights   
That rival bohemian days.

### Part Two: R. Roscoe Tanner

Whenever I go to the office   
I sport a conservative tie   
A suit and gray socks, a plastic lunch box   
Containing some lunch meat on rye   
I carefully drive to the campus   
The very first one to arrive   
Then prudently cover my Nissan   
Until I drive homeward at five   
What a life! What a bore!   
But if you watch closely you'll see something more!

Beneath all that gray, tennis whites gleam away   
They're just waiting till they can appear   
And under my jacket a splendid new racket   
Is making a bulge in the rear   
I slip by the floor with my name on the door   
And escape to the courts from 8:30 to 4:00  
My service makes men nervous   
And my bankhand just puts them to flight   
At the net I'm sublime, it's six-love every time  
Whenever I don tennis whites!

### Part Three: What do you think I am - a bank?

When EVC Tanner took office   
The deans came requesting more cash.   
They said, "What a shame, and we think you're to blame   
We must have more money and fast!"   
I resisted their pressure and told them,   
"It's not quite so simple, you see.   
You've got to manage your budgets   
And find other means besides me.   
Don't you know? Times are tight.   
There isn't more money, there's no change in sight."

They acted so tragic. They wanted some magic,   
But no silver bullet was there.   
Said one dean with glee, "I need more FTE  
Or my NRC ranking won't fare!"   
"You must understand, I use no sleight of hand   
I don't have resources, and so you must plan   
To raise money. T'would be sunny  
If you found a donor or two.   
There's no easy magic, stop looking so tragic.  
I know there's much more you can do."

The deans quickly took up the challenge.   
The stock market rose to its best.   
The dollar grew strong and it wasn't too long   
'Til donors coughed up with more zest.   
With challenges met, I considered   
The pleasures of scholarly thought   
Back to my research and teaching,   
Combined with devotion to sport.  
Don't you think it sounds grand   
To leave all those headaches and financial plans?

They acted so tragic, I wanted some magic   
More freedom and fun in my life   
Said MRCG, "Please remain EVC."   
And I said, "But the time, is just right!"   
I knew there was more; yes! That knock at my door!   
I remembered a promise I'd made years before   
To the theater. Nothing sweeter:   
A chance to break out of my cage.   
And how Michael's story transformed into glory,   
We'll reveal when we next take the stage.

### Part Four: The Next Chapter

One day, it was back in the eighties   
A knocking was heard at my door  
Opportunity came, Audrey Stanley by name  
To ask me if I'd tread the boards!  
I said I was frankly delighted   
My ego was ready to burst   
But then I collected my reason:   
Of course I would need to rehearse.   
Eighteen years! That's a lot!   
But when my debut came, mon dieu, was I HOT!

I acted so tragic the house rose like magic   
They thought my Macbeth was sublime   
To honor my knowledge, they gave me Cowell College   
They threw it one brick at a time   
Then old Lady Maccers who really was crackers   
Removed every stitch and appalled all the backers   
The curtain was now certain   
And I was not e'en out of breath   
They threw eggs and potatoes, organic tomatoes  
The night I appeared as Macbeth.

I rented a hall on Pacific   
Invited my colleagues and friends  
I worked pretty hard at decoding the bard  
Embracing post-modernist trends   
I added some jokes in the middle   
A scene where I play the guitar   
I rewrote a much snappier ending  
To teach at my next seminar   
Poor old Bill. Couldn't write.  
But now that I've fixed it he'll sound pretty bright.

I acted so tragic the house rose like magic I wished Patrick Stewart could see   
But he's out in space and then someone quite base   
Suggested that's where I should be   
A man said "I'm blessed if he isn't crossed dressed  
Oh give us a break and give gender a rest"   
With a bodice like a goddess  
And a boa that choked me to death   
In my shimmering gown, four inch heels and a crown  
Zut Alors! I excelled as Macbeth!
