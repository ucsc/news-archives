title: Employees Can Make Benefits Changes Through November 21
author: UCSC Currents
---

The time to make changes in benefits is at hand. Many changes can be made only once a year, during Open Enrollment. This year Open Enrollment takes place from Saturday, November 1 through Friday, November 21. Any changes that employees would like to make to medical, dental, vision, DepCare, and TIP plans must be made during this time period. Changes take effect January 1, 1998.

For the third year, Open Enrollment changes will be made through the Open Enrollment Action Line. All employees should receive a benefits statement at their home addresses that provides instructions on how to make changes. If you have not received the statement, call the Benefits Office for assistance.

Two significant changes have occurred that will affect those enrolled in Health Net and FHP plans.

Employees enrolled in FHP Health Care will no longer be served by that plan, which merged earlier this year with PacifiCare. Those who are signed up with FHP and take no action during open enrollment will automatically be covered by PacifiCare.

The other change to take effect this year is that both PacifiCare and Health Net have expanded their contracts with area physicians. Those enrolled in either plan can now choose a primary care doctor at either the Santa Cruz Medical Clinic or the Medical Group of Santa Cruz County. Family members may enroll with different groups as long as each member receives all care from the medical group with which he or she is enrolled.

The annual Benefits Fair will take place on Friday, November 7, from noon to 3 p.m. in the Applied Sciences lobby. At the fair will be representatives from Health Net, PacifiCare, Prudential, Delta Dental, PMI Dental, Managed Health Network, PacifiCare Behavioral Health, and Vision Service Plan. For more information, call the Benefits Office.
