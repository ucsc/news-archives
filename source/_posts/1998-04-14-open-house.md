SANTA CRUZ, CA-The University of California, Santa Cruz, will host the Banana Slug Spring Fair on Saturday, April 18. UCSC alumni, current and prospective students, and their families are invited to the annual celebration, which features faculty lectures, artistic performances, facility tours, and alumni reunions. The fair begins at 9 a.m. It drew more than 4,000 people to the campus last year.

Tours will take in the art studios, UCSC's eight individual colleges, Long Marine Laboratory, the UCSC Farm, the Arboretum, and facilities for physical education and recreation.

At Porter College at 10:30 a.m., Marge Frantz, American studies and women's studies lecturer emerita, will discuss how political activism has changed in the past 25 years in a lecture titled "Looking Forward, Looking Backward, Looking Under the Bed." Two panels of alumni will honor Frantz at Kresge College in the afternoon. At Cowell College, Professor Emeritus Douglas McClellan and Professor John Dizikes will give a presentation titled "The White Gallery: Poems and Paintings." Shakespeare To Go will present a performance of Much Ado About Nothing.

Events for alumni include a reunion lunch for all classes and a reunion dinner for the class of '78. (Please call 408/459-2530 for space availability.) On Sunday, April 19, a picnic for classics majors and an alumni gathering at the Santa Cruz Hillel center are also planned.
