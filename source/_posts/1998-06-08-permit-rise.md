author: Francine Tyler

Faculty and staff will pay more for parking permits in the 1998-99 year, according to Transportation and Parking Services. "A," "B," and "C" permits will rise from $29 to $32 a month--an increase of $36 per year--effective July 1. Motorcycle, remote, and "scratch-off" permits will also increase, with the exception of the first packet of 50 "scratch-off" permits, which will be reduced to $80 from $100.

The parking fee increase will help pay for a number of TAPS projects, including renovating and expanding the Performing Arts lot, improving the intersection at Coolidge Drive and Campus Facilities, and the construction of a bus pullout at Colleges Nine and Ten.
