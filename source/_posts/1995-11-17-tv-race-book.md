SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Million Man March. The O. J. Simpson trial. The  Los Angeles riots. The Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings.

In recent years, current events have put issues of race at the  top of the American agenda, and each of these events is indelibly  linked with television images, says Herman Gray, an associate  professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz,  who has just published a new book Watching Race: Television and the  Struggle for "Blackness" (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press,  1995).

"The interesting thing about the Million Man March, the O. J.  trial, and the Clarence Thomas hearings as television events is how  they forced people to choose sides," says Gray. "Television's  simplistic coverage of events obscures the complicated questions  about race, class, justice, morality, and family that came into play  with these events."

Television depends on spectacle, drama, and the tension  between good and bad, says Gray, noting that recent current events  have provided perfect fodder for TV news. Situation comedies,  produced by the entertainment side of the industry, rely on a similar  formula, says Gray, whose book traces the emergence of innovative  black-oriented situation comedies during the 1980s and early 1990s  and examines the interplay of television and cultural politics.

Even as television news in the 1980s played into the hands of  Ronald Reagan's conservative agenda by airing images of what Gray  calls the "black menace"--black male gang members, crumbling black  families, and black "welfare cheats"--sitcoms reflected the  explosion in black popular culture that was marked by African  American literature, film, rap music, and hip-hop style. Ushered in  by the success of "The Cosby Show," shows such as "Frank's Place,"  "Roc," "A Different World," and "In Living Color" pushed the  boundaries of network television by addressing issues of importance  to blacks, says Gray.

Gray specializes in the way television represents blacks and  the way those representations affect concepts of blackness within  the black community. He participated in Color Adjustment, the  independent documentary film on the history of black  representations in television and the just-released three-part  series Signal to Noise, an independent documentary on contemporary  television.

"The explosion of black youth culture opened up what we saw  on television," says Gray. "At the same time, there was an enormous  explosion of black cinema, black feminist scholarship, and black  sexuality as black lesbians and gay men asserted themselves. What  was happening with television was really part of this explosion of  black images, as blacks attempted to authorize and author our own  representations."

Gray points out that issues of race are not limited to relations  between the races. "The discussion of blackness is also about what  constitutes the black identity, the black self. It's a discussion that's  internal to the black community, and I look at these shows from this  perspective," says Gray.

"African Americans are continually engaged in making claims  about who we are and what our cultural riches are," adds Gray.  "Television is still a place where you can see different kinds of  claims being made about what constitutes the black experience."

The television industry is in a constant state of flux, notes  Gray. Neoconservatives have again seized on images of race to help  them consolidate their domestic political program, observes Gray.  Recent network mergers will contribute to a drop in innovative  programming, and the emergence of Fox Television as a "recognized  player" that can win national football contracts and broadcast the  Academy Awards show will erode its commitment to urban black  audiences, he predicts. Nevertheless, television remains an  important site of black representations, and although particular  shows will come and go, black popular culture, as well as black  television makers, audiences, and programmers, will continue to  impact the look and feel of commercial network television, says  Gray.

Many dismiss television as "cotton candy for the eye," but Gray  says the medium deserves much more careful scrutiny. He decided to  address the question of how television affects ideas about blackness  when he became annoyed by the lack of sophisticated discussion  about television and race. "I'm interested in the media's role in  organizing how we see the world," says Gray. "As a critical  television scholar, I became very bothered that the innovative  television studies always rendered race as a footnote."
