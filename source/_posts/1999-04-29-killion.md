## Local Artist/publisher Tom Killion Featured At UCSC Library Event

When: Thursday May 20, 4 p.m.

What: Friends of the UCSC Library annual meeting and reception featuring artist and publisher Tom Killion

Where: University of California, Santa Cruz McHenry Library Patio

The Friends of the UCSC Library are happy to announce that local artist and publisher Tom Killion will be the featured speaker for the group's annual meeting.

The annual gathering, which features a prominent author or artist each year, includes a brief business meeting to elect new members of the Friends Board of Directors and a reception. It is free and open to the public.

A renowned fine-book printer, Killion was trained by master printers William Everson and Jack Stauffacher. Killion earned his degree in history at UCSC, where he founded Quail Press in 1977. He has published nine illustrated books and teaches part-time at San Francisco State University. His works have been exhibited at the British Museum, the Stanford Rare Book Library, the Yosemite Renaissance, and the La Galerie Blanche in Carnac, France.

At the May 20 meeting, Killion will speak on his newest book, The High Sierra of California, which was recently purchased by the Friends for UCSC's collection. The book includes some 25 wood and linocut prints of California's Sierra mountains, printed on handmade Japanese paper. The hand-printed text includes excerpts from never- before-published journals chronicling Gary Snyder's experiences in the Sierra during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as a selection of Snyder's poetry, passages from John Muir's journals, and Killion's winter mountaineering tales.
