This spring the Arts Division will celebrate the arts at UCSC with an open house on May 2 and a series of free arts events and programs.

Celebrate the Arts at UCSC is taking place in recognition of many recent events in the campus's Arts Division: The completion of major construction projects, the expansion of academic programs, and the addition of exceptional new faculty.

"In our teaching and research at UCSC we strive for a collaboration of the best artists and scholars that we can attract--emerging artists, teachers of the arts, students, and audiences--all those who engage the arts in their lives," said Edward Houghton, dean of the arts at UCSC.

"Most of us belong to several of those categories, and the arts belong to all of us. We hope that everyone who plays a role in making the arts so vital in our community will join us in this special celebration."

All events are free and open to the public. Seating is available on a first-come, first-served basis. For more information or special-needs requests, please call (831) 459-2787.
