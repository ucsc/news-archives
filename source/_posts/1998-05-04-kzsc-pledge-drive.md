author: Barbara McKenna

KZSC's fund drive, which begins this month, is an annual occurrence, but this year's event is a special one because it marks the campus radio station's 25th year of broadcasting.

The station's 25th Anniversary Pledge Drive begins May 11 and runs through May 22 with a fund-raising goal of $25,000.

Located at 88.1 FM, KZSC began broadcasting in April of 1973. At 1250 watts, the station has the greatest broadcasting power of any UC station, reaching listeners across the Monterey Bay's three-county area. Along with broadcasting, the station serves as a training ground for students. In 1995, the station received the _Metro Santa Cruz_ Gold Award for best radio station.

The diverse programming format includes the public affairs programs _Talkabout_ and _Closet Free Radio,_ music shows of every imaginable genre, and news programming. One of the first shows to broadcast on the station still exists. The show, sponsored by the Women's Radio Collective, started as a UCSC class and began broadcasting in 1974. This show, _Breakfast in Bed,_ airs Sunday mornings from 9 a.m. to noon.

Funds raised during this month's drive will support plans to replace an aging transmitter and upgrade broadcast equipment.
