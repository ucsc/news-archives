Community studies prof **Patricia Zavella** featured prominently in a recent _Los Angeles Times_ story entitled "Sex, Sexuality, Homosexuality Emerge as Hot Topics for Latinos." The article cited Zavella's essay about how two Latinas learned about sex as an example of a new wave of Latino scholarship that is delving deeper into the private and personal.

Cosmologist **Joel Primack** and astronomer **Sandra Faber** were both quoted in an article in the _Seattle Post-Intelligencer_ about the implications of recent developments in cosmology, including the discovery of the most distant galaxy ever detected, nearly 13 billion light-years from Earth. Primack and Faber both took part in the recent "Cosmic Questions" conference in Washington, D.C., which brought together theologians and scientists to exchange views on the nature of the universe. Primack helped organize the conference.

The Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group's **Brian Latta** was featured in a front-page photo in the _San Francisco Chronicle,_ rescuing a group of peregrine falcon chicks from the Antioch Bridge. The accompanying story explained that the birds were removed from their nest to prevent them from falling into the San Joaquin River and drowning when they test their wings. They will be raised by foster falcons.

**Daniel Press** of environmental studies was quoted in a recent _Sacramento Bee_ article about efforts to preserve open space in the Sacramento area. He says the story generated more calls from researchers and people in public agencies who wanted additional information than any other media exposure he's gotten.

The discovery of new planets outside the solar system continues to generate news stories, and reporters often turn to professor of astronomy and astrophysics **Douglas Lin** to interpret the findings. Most recently, Lin was quoted in a _New York Times_ article about the impact of the latest findings on the field of planetary science.

A story in the _San Jose Mercury News_ about two California sea otters headed for an aquarium in Denver featured Long Marine Lab's head trainer **Billy Hurley** and senior trainer **Heather Norman.** The sea otters were rescued by the Monterey Bay Aquarium after being orphaned as pups, but efforts to release them back into the wild failed. Hurley and Norman have been retraining the pair for life in a public aquarium.

**Elliot Aronson**'s latest major career award from the American Psychological Association prompted the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ to splash the news across its front page. Look also for upcoming coverage in the _San Jose Mercury News'_ weekend magazine, _West_. . . . Aronson's colleague in psychology, **Anthony Pratkanis,** has fielded a string of media calls recently and has done interviews with "The Infinite Mind," a public radio program that was preparing a show on persuasion. He also spoke with a reporter from Gannett News Services regarding a story pegged to Memorial Day about the violent content of many national anthems. . . . Oh, and **Jean Fox Tree**'s work on the role of the word "oh" in speech was picked up by _Zest_ magazine.

Arboretum director **Ron Enomoto** made an appearance on KION Channel 46, showing reporter Romney Dunbar around the Arboretum in the "Travels with Romney" segment on the evening news.

The _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ ran a profile of associate professor of computer engineering **Kevin Karplus,** focusing on his car-free lifestyle. Karplus relies exclusively on his bicycle and buses for transportation and maintains that it is not as difficult as most people think it is to get around without a car.

**Ronnie Lipschutz**'s acerbic op-ed about Clinton's public statements regarding the Kosovar conflict appeared in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel._

Biologist **Don Croll** was quoted in a _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ article about humpback whales in Monterey Bay. Humpbacks have been seen breaching close to shore in Capitola, the article said. Croll said an abundance of krill, the whales' main food source, should make this a good year for whale watching.

The _Sentinel_ also published an opinion piece by professor emeritus of chemistry **Joseph Bunnett,** who noted that UCSC has always had faculty who were highly respected in their fields and engaged in serious research, even in the early years when the campus had a reputation as a "hippie haven."
