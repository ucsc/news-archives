Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry   

Theodore Holman uses chemical and biochemical techniques to study the biological functions of enzymes that contain  iron or other metal atoms. Two of his current projects explore metalloproteins that regulate heme biosynthesis and play key roles in the formation of fatty plaques that can trigger heart disease. Holman earned his B.A. from UC San Diego and his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis, both in chemistry. He worked previously at Harvard Medical School, Syntex Pharmaceuticals, and UC Riverside.
