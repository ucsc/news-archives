SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Institute of Marine Sciences at the University  of California, Santa Cruz, already a key link in the growing chain of  scientific institutions in the Monterey Bay Area, has received a  significant boost from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation of  Los Altos: a $1 million award to create an Endowment in Ocean  Science and Technology.

Interest from the endowment will help fund collaborative  projects among marine scientists at UCSC, the Monterey Bay  Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), and other regional research  organizations. The Packard Foundation will pay into the endowment  in three equal installments, beginning this month and continuing in  March 1996 and March 1997. By the time the endowment is fully in  place, its annual interest should provide about $50,000 per year for  marine research.

"The Packard Foundation has been extremely generous in  supporting public universities at a time when other sources of  funding have diminished," says UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister. "The  new endowment will increase our visibility in the ocean-science  research community and will help us attract outstanding  researchers and students to UCSC."

Pister credits UCSC's strong record of achievement in ocean  science and technology, as well as existing grassroots  collaborations between scientists and engineers at UCSC and MBARI,  for the success of the proposal to the Packard Foundation. Prospects  of even stronger ties between the two institutions--and among the  others ringing Monterey Bay--have excited the researchers who  helped write the proposal.

"This is the first source of funding that is specifically to  enhance collaborative efforts," says associate vice chancellor for  research James Gill, a professor of earth sciences at UCSC. "The  Monterey Bay research community is comparable to Scripps or Woods  Hole, but it's very distributed. This funding will begin to help knit  the institutions together--and the money will always be there."

Gill notes that the award may help attract businesses in ocean  science and technology and related fields to the area, due to the  enhanced collaborations among institutions.

Professor of earth sciences Gary Griggs, director of the  Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS), will allocate the annual proceeds  from the endowment, assisted by a campus committee and in  consultation with MBARI and other organizations. Griggs envisions  that the endowment will provide "seed money" in a variety of areas,  including the following:

\-- Initial funding for visiting researchers or leading graduate  students working in ocean science and technology.

\-- Collaborative and multidisciplinary projects that take  advantage of the research potential of Monterey Bay and the  surrounding deep ocean.

\-- Efforts to improve communication links among the area's  research institutions.

"The endowment will give us a jump start for some cutting- edge research programs, especially in areas where it can be a  challenge to secure federal and other funding," Griggs says. "The IMS  budget has been essentially unchanged for five or six years, and  most of that is committed to salaries and facilities. This funding  will give us the flexibility to bring in some exciting people and  pursue new partnerships with institutions around the bay."

The Packard Foundation is a driving force behind the  burgeoning education and research programs in the area, through its  support of MBARI and other institutions. The foundation was created  in 1964 to support and encourage organizations that depend on  private funding and volunteer leadership. It makes grants for  programs in the arts, the community, ocean science, the  environment, population issues, education, and children's health.

Last year, the Packard Foundation granted $200,000 toward a  planned Visitor Education Center at the Joseph M. Long Marine  Laboratory, a coastal marine-research station operated by UCSC. To  date, donors and foundations have committed about $2 million to the  center, which will improve the lab's education programs for  schoolchildren and the public. The facility will cost about $4.4  million for construction and exhibitions.

The Packard Foundation also awarded a $500,000 fellowship  last year to UCSC biochemist Joseph Puglisi. Twenty of the coveted  fellowships, worth $100,000 per year for five years, go annually to  outstanding young researchers across the nation. The foundation  began the fellowship program in 1988.
