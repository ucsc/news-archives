With the campus area code changing to 831 on Saturday, July 11, a six-month grace period has begun in which callers can use the old 408 code or the new code.

Because of the area code change, many campus units are ordering new business cards. Those units that have not yet placed orders should be aware of work that is nearly completed on a new official card for UCSC.
