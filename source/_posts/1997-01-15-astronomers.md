SANTA CRUZ, CA--Astronomers and astrophysicists at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, published some of the most  notable research papers in their field in recent years, according to a  new study by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) of  Philadelphia.

Analysts at ISI studied the impacts of all space-science  papers published from 1993 to 1995 by tallying the number of  citations earned by each paper. When researchers publish a journal  article, they must cite previous papers by other authors that set the  stage for their work. Generally, a paper garners more citations when  scientists accept the work as important and well done.

UC Santa Cruz ranked twelfth among the world's astronomy  research institutions in terms of the total number of citations  received and eleventh in terms of the average number of citations  per paper. ISI analysts consider the latter measure as the most  objective way to gauge the quality of a department's research.

Ten other institutions ranked in the top fifteen in both  measures: Princeton University, the University of Cambridge, the  NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center, UC Berkeley, the Space Telescope  Science Institute, the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial  Physics (Germany), the Institut d'Astrophysique Paris, the  University of Wisconsin, MIT, and the University of Arizona. (See the  following tables of top twenty institutions.)

The new study is consistent with recent rankings published by  the National Research Council, which rated the quality of graduate  departments according to their reputations among peers. In that  study, UCSC's Astronomy and Astrophysics Department ranked sixth  among all U.S. universities.

UCSC is renowned for research in both observational  astronomy and theoretical astrophysics. Santa Cruz astronomers are  among the primary users of the Hubble Space Telescope and the W. M.  Keck Observatory in Hawaii, home of the world's largest optical  telescopes. Special areas of focus include the evolution,  distribution, and nature of stars and galaxies.

In astrophysics, UCSC scientists excel in studies of  cosmology, planetary and solar system formation, models of galaxy  collisions, and supernovas. Faculty members and staff technicians  also are among the world's leading designers of instruments and  optical components for telescopes.

Analysis considers only "high-impact" papers (those receiving 10 or  more citations) published between 1993 and 1995. Institutions  ranked include only those that published 30 or more high-impact  papers in that three-year period. Citation impact is the total number  of high-impact papers divided by the total number of citations  received.
