title: Cosmologist To Discuss Our Universe--and The Chance That Others Exist 
author: Robert Irion

SANTA CRUZ, CA--What is the fate of our universe? Is there some  deep reason why this universe allowed creatures to evolve who can  try to understand it? Does it make sense to talk about other  universes, perhaps governed by quite different physical laws?

Those are some of the fascinating issues that noted  cosmologist Sir Martin Rees will address in a free public lecture on  Thursday, March 2, at UC Santa Cruz. The lecture, entitled "Our  Universe and Others," will begin at 8 p.m. in lecture hall B-206 of  the Earth and Marine Sciences Building.

"The varied structures in our present universe--stars,  galaxies, and black holes--have all evolved from a hot fireball which  exploded about 13 billion years ago," says Rees. Thanks to advances  in astronomy and theoretical astrophysics, he notes, "We now can  address some new fundamental questions about the history and  future of the universe."

Rees, a British scientist who was knighted in 1992 for his  contributions to astrophysics, is one of the world's most  distinguished cosmologists. He is known especially for his studies  of the early universe, galaxy formation, and quasars. With writer  John Gribbin, he coauthored The Stuff of the Universe: Dark Matter,  Mankind, and the Coincidences of Cosmology. The subtitle alludes to  Rees's longstanding interest in the philosophical issues raised by  modern theories of cosmology.

Rees's visit to UCSC is cosponsored by UCO/Lick Observatory  and the departments of astronomy and astrophysics and physics. His  talk is part of the Delphasus Lecture Series, funded by a private gift  to UCSC to increase public appreciation of issues in astronomy and  physics.

Further information or directions to the lecture hall are  available from the UCSC Public Information Office at 459-2495.
