title: Aftershocks Expose Plate Motions And A Weak Fault At The Mendocino Triple Junction Off Northern California

SAN FRANCISCO, CA--Aftershocks of three large earthquakes at Cape  Mendocino, California, in April 1992 have shed new light on the  interplay among three tectonic plates at the Mendocino Triple  Junction, one of the country's most complex seismic settings.

A detailed study of the aftershocks suggests that the Gorda  plate, a wedge of Pacific Ocean seafloor, is plunging in fits and  starts under the North American and Pacific plates in the process  called subduction. Other scientists have believed that the Gorda  plate subducts only beneath the North American plate.

In addition, the study indicates that the fault between the  Gorda and North American plates is weak: It broke even though the  stress in the direction of the earthquake rupture was relatively low  before the main quake.

Study author Susan Schwartz, director of the W. M. Keck  Seismological Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Cruz,  compares the fault to the Santa Cruz Mountains segment of the San  Andreas Fault, site of the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989. "In both  cases, the regional stress field was not favorably oriented to make  the faults slip," she says. "Only a little shear stress was enough to  make them move. However, both events showed that even with a  weak fault, you can still have large earthquakes."

The Mendocino Triple Junction marks the southern limit of the  Cascadia Subduction Zone, which threatens the Pacific Northwest  with potential quakes of magnitude 8 or larger. Two other faults  converge on the subduction zone at the triple junction: the offshore  Mendocino Fault and the northern end of the San Andreas Fault (see  attached Figure 1). Near the junction, all three faults largely vanish,  leaving seismologists in the past to scratch their heads about how  the tectonic plates interact there.

That all changed on April 25, 1992, when a magnitude 7.1  earthquake struck near the triple junction at Petrolia, about 30  miles south of Eureka. Two magnitude 6.6 aftershocks caused further  damage the next day. Within a day, Schwartz and a team from  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the University of  Oregon began to deploy portable seismometers. The team placed  eleven sensitive instruments in a 50-mile zone around Petrolia. The  instruments measured ground motions in such detail that Schwartz  could calculate both the locations of the aftershocks and their focal  mechanisms--the exact ways in which they ruptured the earth. For  her study, Schwartz used about 30 of the biggest aftershocks  (greater than magnitude 3), plus records from 30 other quakes of  previous years.

The data painted a clear picture of the stresses in the region  of the triple junction, which are dominated by the motions of the  Gorda plate, Schwartz found. During the main quake, the plate slid at  a shallow angle--nearly horizontally--under the North American  plate. However, most of the aftershocks sliced through the earth on  vertical or steeply dipping faults on the boundary between the Gorda  and Pacific plates. "In general, most aftershocks occur on the same  plane, and with the same sense of motion, as the main shock," says  Schwartz. "Here, none of the aftershocks did so."

Schwartz used these results to make a model of the plate  interactions (see attached Figure 2). Far west of the triple junction,  the young and hot Gorda plate--born at the undersea Gorda Rise-- butts up against the old and rigid Pacific plate, which prevents the  Gorda plate from subducting. This creates earthquakes along the  Mendocino Fault and within the Gorda plate itself as the plate is  squeezed. Toward the triple junction, where the Pacific plate ends,  the Gorda plate dives under both the North American plate and a  corner of the Pacific plate. Schwartz notes that seismic profiles of  the region reveal a cold slab dipping both to the east and the south,  which supports the model.

The Cascadia Subduction Zone runs almost parallel to the  direction of the regional stress at the triple junction, Schwartz  found. Only a small component of the stress points in the direction  of the Gorda plate's subduction under the North American plate.  Nevertheless, it was enough to trigger the magnitude 7.1 quake. To  Schwartz, this indicates that the fault is weak, perhaps because  fluids lubricate it far underground. As an analogy, consider sliding  one brick past another by pushing them together, with just a pinch of  side-to-side force. Bricks with smooth surfaces or with a thin layer  of water between them are much more likely to slide than rough and  dry ones.

Schwartz cautions that her conclusions are unique to the triple  junction. "This is just the southern tip of the Cascadia Subduction  Zone," she says. "The presence of a third fault makes the situation  much more complicated than in the rest of the zone. This simply is a  model that may help us better understand the plate geometry at this  one location."

Schwartz's study was made possible by the Rapid Array  Mobilization Program of the Incorporated Research Institutions for  Seismology (IRIS).
