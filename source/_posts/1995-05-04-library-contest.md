**Contest Expands This Year To Include Local High School Students**

SANTA CRUZ--Winners of the 29th Annual Book Collection Contest at  the University of California, Santa Cruz, were announced at an  awards ceremony held on Thursday, April 20, at McHenry Library. The  annual contest, which is sponsored by the Friends of the UCSC  Library, was expanded this year to include local high school  students.

The contest is open to students who own a book collection of  personal significance comprised of at least 25 titles. Rather than  actually owning a collection, high school participants were asked to  imagine a collection that would reflect a passionate interest, and to  expand the collection to include nonprint media as well. To enter the  contest, participants submitted a bibliography and an essay  describing the special value of their collections.

Winners of the university-level competition receive both a  cash award and Bookshop Santa Cruz gift certificates of $150, $100,  and $50. The winners are: First prize ($300), Davina Ramirez, a  senior majoring in linguistics from Santa Cruz, for "Restriction,  Proscriptions, Conception: Intersections and Collisions between  Gender and Science." Second prize ($200), Mara Mills, a senior  majoring in biology and literature from Menlo Park, for "Magical  Prague." Third prize ($100), Gina Sanchez, a senior majoring in  modern literary studies from Pasadena, for "Chess: The Teacher and  Imitator of Life."

Winners of the high school competition receive half of their  prizes as cash for personal use and half in the form of bookstore gift  certificates for their school library. They are: First prize ($300),  Cheryl Lin, a senior at Santa Cruz High School, for "Searching for the  Past: A Journey through China's History." Second prize ($200), Sarah  Borchelt, a senior at Harbor High School, for "Photography: A  Collection." Third prize ($100), Laura Kelley, a senior at Santa Cruz  High School, for "Running."

This year's prizes were supported by donations from Neal  Coonerty, owner of Bookshop Santa Cruz; David Watson, owner of the  Literary Guillotine bookstore; and Lee Duffus, a board member of the  Friends of the UCSC Library and owner of Bookworks in Aptos. The  contest is also endowed by a deferred gift from Ethel Hammond  Curtis.

Contest judges for the university student competition were  John Dizikes, professor of American studies at UCSC; Kay Bowden,  Friends of the UCSC Library board member; and Karen Mokrzycki,  head of acquisitions at the University Library. Contest judges for the  high school student competition were, Don Rothman, a senior  lecturer in writing at UCSC; Mary K. Simpson, president of the  Friends of the UCSC Library; and Michael Gant, Friends of the UCSC  Library board member.

Along with annual sponsorship of the contest, the Friends of  the UCSC Library makes substantial gifts of books, videos, and other  materials to the library that cannot be purchased through regular  budget funds. Selections from the winning collections will be on  display in McHenry Library until May 5. For library hours and more  information, call (408) 459-2801.
