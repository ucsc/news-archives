![\[Photo of gymnasium on Scholars Day\]][1] Approximately 185 academically outstanding UCSC applicants attended Scholars Day on Saturday, March 14. The event, held at the West Field House, attracted approximately 470 people, including the prospective students and their family members. 

Scholars Day celebrates the academic excellence of UCSC's faculty, programs, and students and provides prospective students attending the event--who are academically in the top 7 percent of freshman applicants to UCSC, based on GPA and SAT scores--with information about the campus's people, programs, and facilities.

Event participants were also able to tour a residence hall and the general campus and explore a computer lab. 

During lunch, research professor of astronomy and astrophysics Frank Drake and social sciences dean Martin Chemers gave presentations on their research.
