The Santa Cruz Area Chamber of Commerce has chosen Chancellor **M.R.C. Greenwood **as** **this year's Woman of the Year. Her success in forging partnerships with the local community and her efforts to make the university more visible were among the contributions for which she will be honored. The chamber will bestow the award at its Annual Community Recognition Dinner and Dance at the Cocoanut Grove on Friday, November 13. Awards will also be presented to Scott Kennedy, Man of the Year; News Channel 46, Business of the Year; and the Santa Cruz County Symphony, Organization of the Year. The event starts at 6 p.m. and dancing begins at 9:15 p.m. All members of the community are invited to attend; tickets are $55/person or $100/couple. For more information or to purchase a ticket, contact the Santa Cruz Area Chamber of Commerce at (831) 423-1111.

**Jamie Cate,** a postdoctoral fellow in UCSC's Center for Molecular Biology of RNA, has been awarded the 1998 Pharmacia Amersham Biotech & Science Prize for Young Scientists for the North American region. The prize includes an award of $5,000, which Cate will receive at a ceremony in Sweden held in parallel with the Nobel Prize ceremony in early December.

Cate won the award for his essay entitled "Structural basis for an RNA world." The essay was based on his thesis research at Yale University, which involved solving the X-ray crystal structure of a biologically important RNA molecule. He is currently working on the crystal structure of the ribosome in the laboratory of Harry Noller, the Robert L. Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology. Cate's work is supported by a fellowship from the Damon Runyan-Walter Winchell Cancer Research Foundation.

The Pharmacia Amersham Biotech & Science Prize for Young Scientists recognizes outstanding graduate students in molecular biology from all regions of the world. This year there were five regional winners and one grand prize winner. The prize was established by _Science_ magazine and the pharmaceutical company Pharmacia Amersham Biotech to provide support to scientists at the beginning of their careers.
