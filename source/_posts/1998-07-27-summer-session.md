---

Classes start August 3 for this summer's second session of courses at UCSC. The courses are five weeks long and cover a wide range of academic subjects, from introduction to archaeology to Native American conceptions of nature.

The final day to register without a $55 late fee is Friday, July 31. Friday, August 7, is the final day to register with payment of the late fee. Courses are filled on a first-come, first-served basis.

UCSC's Summer Session is divided into two five-week course blocks, with a few four-, seven-, and ten-week courses falling outside those two main sessions.
