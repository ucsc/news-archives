SANTA CRUZ, CA--Thanks in part to students from the University of  California, Santa Cruz, it's a snap to peek inside the new home of  San Jose's Tech Museum of Innovation, which won't even open for  two more years. All visitors have to do is turn on a computer and  tune to the World Wide Web.

UCSC undergraduates designed and built four of the first six  exhibits in the museum's new on-line creation, called the  "HyperTech." Guests to these exhibits hunt for genes to learn about  DNA, shoot lasers at cataracts to see how lasers work, break  computer codes to learn about privacy in the computer age, and  watch the ground shake in an exhibit on earthquakes.

The students created the exhibits as part of an advanced class  in on-line publishing led by Marti Atkinson, instructional  development specialist in UCSC's Division of Natural Sciences.  Working closely with exhibit developers from the Tech Museum and  with experts from the Adobe Corporation, student teams gathered  information, illustrated, created animations, wrote, and programmed  the Web pages.

"I'm tickled pink!" says Mike Rose, Web publisher for the Tech  Museum. "I think this partnership we have going is better than we  could have imagined." The Tech Museum provided partial funding for  the UCSC projects.

Beyond figuring out how to integrate technology and education  for the HyperTech, students worked out the details of building  museum exhibits. They debated the merits of ideas such as a laser- shooting pickle, a talking firefly, talking dogs, and mutating the  names of visitors. By the end of the quarter, the exhibits blossomed  from outlines and storyboards to entertaining educational displays.

Atkinson's class also heard from guest lecturers funded by an  instructional improvement minigrant. Professionals visited to teach  the newest tricks and advanced languages used on the Web, including  Shockwave, Perl, JAVA, and virtual reality modeling language  (VRML).

Students in Atkinson's previous classes built Web sites for  nonprofit organizations in the Monterey Bay Area. She hopes to  continue the UCSC partnership with the Tech Museum by creating  more exhibits in future classes.

The virtual exhibits are a preview to the 1998 opening of the  Tech Museum's new $59 million facility in downtown San Jose.  Viewers may point their Web browsers to the following address (for  best results, use Netscape 2.0 or above): <http://www.thetech.org,> then click on "HyperTech."
