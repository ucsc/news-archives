## Governor Names UCSC Vice Chancellor To Higher Education Panel

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Francisco J. Hernandez, vice chancellor of student affairs at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been named by Governor Gray Davis to the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE).

The commission facilitates resource sharing among higher education in its 15 member states. Its programs include an initiative to help states use new technologies more effectively for education, a doctoral scholars program to increase the diversity of college faculty, a program that helps states prepare a qualified mental health workforce, an electronic communications forum linking the North American academic community, policy exchanges, and a student exchange program that serves more than 9,000 students each year. Commission members serve on a volunteer basis.

Hernandez, 52, of Scotts Valley, has been an administrator of higher education for 20 years. Since 1994, he has been at UCSC, where he is responsible for the quality of student life through residential life programs, student services, and enrollment services. "This appointment recognizes Vice Chancellor Hernandez's administrative leadership and gives him a forum in which to expand his influence on the future of higher education," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "Our campus benefits greatly from his work here, and I am pleased that he will be making contributions in a broader context, as well."

Hernandez's experience also includes ten years of teaching, most recently at UCSC, where he has taught courses on minorities in higher education. He is a member of the American Association for Higher Education, the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies, and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities. He earned his undergraduate degree from UC Berkeley and his master's and doctorate from Stanford University.

"Educators have an obligation to work together to maximize their impact," said Hernandez. "The UC system is a key institution among western colleges and universities, and I look forward to working with my fellow commission members to foster our collective success." Hernandez was one of three people whose appointment to WICHE was announced by the governor's office on April 28. Their appointments require Senate confirmation; no date has been set.
