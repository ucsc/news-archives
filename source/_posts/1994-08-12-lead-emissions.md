title: Controls Of Lead Emissions Are Paying Off In The Ocean, According To Measurements Along U.S.-Mexico Coast

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Ocean waters at the border between California  and Mexico contained far less lead in the late 1980s than in the mid  1970s despite substantial increases in population and sewage  disposal, according to new research by scientists at the University  of California, Santa Cruz.

Geochemists Sergio Sanudo-Wilhelmy and Russell Flegal found  three times less lead in seawater samples collected at the border in  1988 than other researchers had measured near the same spot in  1973\. They attribute this decline to strict controls in the United  States over lead emissions into the environment, especially the ban  against leaded gasoline.

The team's study also reveals that further down the coast of  Baja California, most of the lead in the water comes not from the  U.S. but from increasing Mexican emissions. Although the levels of  lead in the ocean are now low, they could rise off Mexico and in  other parts of the globe as developing countries burn more and more  leaded gas, the researchers warn.

"Industrialized countries are controlling their release of lead  into the environment, and it's having an effect--the ocean is  responding and cleaning itself over very short timescales," says  Sanudo-Wilhelmy. "But we don't know what the effects will be from  Third World countries. Their lead inputs could start being more of a  problem."

Sanudo-Wilhelmy and Flegal published their findings in the  current issue (August 1994) of the journal Geochimica et  Cosmochimica Acta. Flegal is a professor of earth sciences at UCSC.  Sañudo-Wilhelmy was a graduate student under Flegal when he  conducted the study; he now is an assistant professor of marine  sciences at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

Flegal, who served on a National Academy of Sciences panel  that investigated lead's toxic effects in the environment, says lead  levels globally are declining as industrialized nations--by far the  biggest lead "offenders" in the past--clean up their acts. In the U.S.,  he notes, "We're seeing lead levels go down in humans, in the air, in  Great Lakes sediments, and in Wisconsin peat bogs. This study is  another piece of evidence that emission controls are working.

"This is a success story," Flegal continues. "We're discharging  much more effluent into the ocean, but the quality of the effluent  has improved. That's good news."

Sanudo-Wilhelmy and Flegal collected their samples at  numerous locations from San Diego southward along 200 miles of  Baja California in June 1988 and June 1989. They used ultraclean  collection and analysis techniques that limited any additional lead  contamination to less than one part per trillion. The researchers  compared their results to those obtained by Clair Patterson of the  California Institute of Technology, who analyzed seawater along the  southern California coast in 1973. Toxicologists regard Patterson's  measurements (published in 1976) as the first reliable figures for  lead in coastal waters.

At the one location where the 1988 data and Patterson's study  overlapped--near the border between the U.S. and Mexico--lead  levels dropped from 36 to 12 parts per trillion. Other recent data  along the southern California coast, not published as part of the new  study, also reflect this threefold decline, says Sañudo-Wilhelmy.  The decrease occurred despite a 42 percent increase in the  population of the surrounding area and a 21 percent increase in  wastewater discharges.

The threefold drop in environmental lead levels from the mid  1970s to the late 1980s shows up in several other ways, Sañudo- Wilhelmy notes. For instance, lead deposited each year in ocean  sediments in the same region declined from 4.5 to 1.6 milligrams  per square meter. According to the U.S. Department of the Interior,  lead released into the atmosphere in the U.S. dropped from 189,000  to 55,000 tons per year, due largely to eliminating lead from  gasoline. (Other industrial activities, such as coal-fired smelting,  still put lead into the air.)

Of the lead the researchers did detect in their samples, nearly  half came from upwelling--lead deposited into the ocean elsewhere,  transported in deep currents, and brought up to the surface again  near the coast. To trace the origins of this lead, the team analyzed  the ratios of subtly different atomic varieties called isotopes. The  ratios they found were typical of lead from Asian countries  bordering the North Pacific.

Along the Baja California coast, lead levels ranged from 4 to 7  parts per trillion--lower than the levels measured near the U.S.- Mexico border. However, an isotopic analysis showed that most of  this lead comes from industrial emissions in Mexico. "As we move  south, we see mainly Mexican lead, probably 90 percent of which is  from leaded gasoline," says Sanudo-Wilhelmy.

Finally, the researchers note in their article the relatively  high (25 parts per trillion) levels of lead they measured within San  Diego Bay. All wastewater discharges into San Diego Bay stopped in  1964, but not before the bay's sediments were contaminated with  lead and other trace metals. Now, it appears these contaminants may  continually cycle back and forth between the sediments and the  water. "Lead concentrations in semi-enclosed bays and estuaries  may remain elevated for decades," the researchers write, "while  lead concentrations in coastal waters may be rapidly reduced within  a period of months."
