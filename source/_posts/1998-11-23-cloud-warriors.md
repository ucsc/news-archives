"Everyone should have at least one functioning alter ego," says Keith Muscutt. "Mine's an explorer."

Muscutt, assistant dean of arts at UCSC, discovered his alter ego in 1973 when he made his first trip to the Chachapoya territory. Located in the Peruvian Andes, the remote region had seen few foreigners at the time of Muscutt's first visit and was virtually unknown to the outside world. A quarter of a century later the area is still relatively unstudied, but its rich history and rugged beauty have been documented to great effect in a just-published book written by Muscutt.

The book, _Warriors of the Clouds_ (University of New Mexico Press, 1998), examines the history of the Chachapoya people, the archaeology of the region, and the lives of the area's modern-day inhabitants with engaging text, maps, bibliography, and more than 80 stunning color photographs by Muscutt.

"At the time of my first visit, I had no idea this would become a lifelong passion," Muscutt said. And, although it would be a decade before he was able to return, Muscutt has since visited the region a total of 16 times, often leading teams attempting to locate and survey previously unmapped Chachapoya ruins. Among these ruins are spectacular masonry tombs found throughout the region, perched on precipitous cliff faces.

The book, released in September, was a primary source for the Discovery Channel program, "The Lost Warriors of the Clouds," which documents the discovery of more than 200 exceptionally well preserved Chachapoya mummies in cliff tombs at the Lake of the Condors. If you missed the recent broadcast, it's not too late: visit the Discovery Channel's Web site for a schedule of upcoming broadcasts. Also at the site is Discovery Channel's online magazine, which features a story on the area and uses Muscutt's photographs.

Muscutt has not only explored the region, he has also established a charitable foundation to support the local community. Created in 1983, Fundación Benéfica Niños de Chuquibamba promotes the health and education of children in the region.

Copies of _Warriors of the Clouds_ are available through Muscutt's [Web site][5] or in area bookstores ($59.95 cloth bound, $29.95 soft cover).
