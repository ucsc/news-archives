The Jack Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz represents a significant expansion of the campus's existing engineering programs. New degree offerings will focus on fields expected to be in great demand, both regionally and nationally, in the next decade. Engineering students will benefit from UCSC's traditionally strong educational approach and will participate in cutting-edge research at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

UCSC is the closest UC campus to the burgeoning high-technology industries of Silicon Valley and the Monterey Bay region, affording many possibilities for students and faculty to collaborate with industrial partners. A wealth of internship and career options will await entrepreneurial students and graduates.
