SANTA CRUZ, CA--Visit a science museum, scan a textbook, or read  any science magazine, and you'll see it: scientific illustration, an art  that both enhances and explains the often complex topics at hand.  It's a growing field, and UC Santa Cruz--thanks to the  internationally renowned illustration track of its Science  Communication Program--plays a key role in training the  illustrators of today and tomorrow.

As evidence of its stature, the Science Communication  Program will host this year's meeting of the Guild of Natural  Science Illustrators, a worldwide organization with some 1,100  members. The meeting, open to registrants only, takes place on  campus the week of August 11.

Attendees will hear talks by some of the world's best-known  illustrators, including a keynote address by Chris Sloan, art director  of National Geographic. Hands-on workshops will cover a wide  variety of techniques, from traditional watercolor, pen and ink, and  scratchboard to the booming business of World Wide Web pages and  computer art tools.

The meeting's activities and speakers will showcase the rich  variety of professional niches for trained scientific illustrators.  According to lecturer Ann Caudle, director of UCSC's graduate  program in science illustration, opportunities exist to work for  scientific journals, popular and specialized magazines, newspapers  and wire services, trade book and textbook publishers, museums,  aquariums, zoos, botanical gardens, and multimedia companies.

"The field of scientific illustration is as diverse as nature,"  Caudle said, noting that illustrators often specialize in disciplines  such as botany, entomology, medicine, archaeology, or astronomy.  "The common denominator is accurate depiction of the modern  world."

Caudle supplied a fascinating laundry list of some recent  projects that reveal the breadth and constant challenge of the field:  illustrating how crows use tools, cataloguing mosquitos in Brazil,  creating the first accurate overhead model of the Grand Canyon,  making a museum model of a tidepool so large that sand grains are  the size of beach balls, animating the flow of blood with a computer,  animating the dynamics of an accident for police, and visualizing  landscapes beyond our solar system.

Guests at the meeting also will go on several field trips to see  fine examples of illustration and gain inspiration from the region's  natural beauty. Planned are visits to the UCSC Arboretum, Monterey  Bay Aquarium, Elkhorn Slough, and the Big Sur Ornithology Lab.

The Guild of Natural Science Illustrators was founded in 1968  by a handful of illustrators at the Smithsonian Institution to  promote professionalism in the industry. Today's members hail from  every state and from countries such as Russia, Spain, Portugal,  Australia, Argentina, and Zimbabwe. Santa Cruz is playing host to  the group for the first time.

The public may view outstanding examples of the guild's work  at an ongoing exhibit at the McPherson Center Museum of Art and  History, 705 Front Street in downtown Santa Cruz. The exhibit,  "Illuminating Science: The 29th Annual Exhibition of the Guild of  Natural Science Illustrators," runs through September 28. Among the  exhibitors are more than a dozen graduates of the illustration track  in UCSC's Science Communication Program.
