On April 18, Save Our Shores will hold a panel discussion in  Santa Cruz regarding a science program known as Acoustic  Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC). As researchers involved  with ATOC, we would like to provide perspective on some aspects of  the program that have caused confusion and concern.

ATOC will search for evidence of global warming, potentially  one of the most serious environmental threats facing our planet.  Program scientists will use sound waves to take the temperature of  the world's oceans, which store an enormous amount of heat. If  global warming is occurring, the ocean will slowly get warmer.  Because sound travels faster in warmer water, ATOC could measure  this subtle change in just a few years.

Media reports have focused on the sounds that ATOC will  produce and their possible effects on marine animals.  Unfortunately, most reports have failed to place these issues in a  context that would have allowed the public to judge the program  fairly. Here are some details that have been overlooked or  inadequately explained:

* The sounds will not be "blasts" or explosions. Instead, they  will be extremely low-pitched rumblings, such as those made by  underwater seismic events. During the 30-month program, ATOC  will broadcast these sounds no more than 8 percent of the time.
* The sound source will not be near Monterey Bay or close to  shore. Rather, it will be under 3,000 feet of water on Sur Ridge,  about 20 miles south of Monterey and 25 miles offshore.
* The most frequently cited intensity of the sounds, 195  decibels, is correct but easily misunderstood for two reasons. First,  195 decibels will be the intensity 3 feet away from the source.  Further away, the intensity will drop very rapidly--one hundredth as  strong 30 feet away, one ten-thousandth as strong 300 feet away,  and so on. Second, decibel levels in water are not the same as those  in air. A rock singer producing 110 decibels in air would need to  belt out 152 decibels in water to create the same pressures on a  listener's ear.
* The source will be no louder than other common sounds in the  ocean. Three feet away, its intensity will be similar to that  produced by the loudest blue whales or a supertanker. At 300 feet,  it will sound no louder than a small freighter. At the surface, the  sounds will be about as intense as those made by porpoises. When  the sounds reach Monterey Bay, they will fade to the level of natural  and constant ocean noise. Only with complex decoding techniques  will researchers "hear" the very faint sounds thousands of miles  away.
* Because of the source's depth and its location away from  biologically rich areas of Monterey Bay, it is extremely unlikely that  the sounds will hurt any marine mammals. The only mammals that  dive as deep as the source are sperm whales and elephant seals.  However, the source will gradually turn on over a 5-minute period,  giving animals enough time to swim out of the small zone where the  sounds could damage their hearing.
* To look for more subtle effects on mammals such as whales,  dolphins, elephant seals, harbor seals, and sea lions, ATOC  scientists plan an extensive research program. It will include  observing animal behavior, monitoring their underwater  communications, and tracking their dives with time-depth recorders  and other instruments.
* No effects on marine animals were seen during a test of this  experiment near Antarctica in 1991. In that test, the sounds were  closer to the surface and much louder.
* The legal language of the federal permit, which discusses  "taking" and "harassing" marine animals, has caused unnecessary  alarm. These terms simply mean that ATOC might change the  behavior of some animals by making them avoid or approach the  sounds. In addition, the large numbers of mammals listed in the  permit are estimated populations for the entire Pacific Ocean, not  just the area near Sur Ridge.

We hope this broader context will encourage a more rational  discussion of the merits of ATOC. It is our view that the sounds  represent a minor addition to the panoply of natural and artificial  noise in the ocean; that the risks to wildlife are remote; and that  the promise of valuable information about global warming--which  truly threatens a vast range of marine life--is great indeed.

We invite citizens to contact us for more information or to  attend the panel discussion, where these issues will be discussed in  detail. The discussion begins at 6:30 p.m. on April 18 at the Santa  Cruz Yacht Club, 244 4th Avenue.
