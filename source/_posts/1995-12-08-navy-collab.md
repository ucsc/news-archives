SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC),  has entered into a unique general agreement of cooperation with the  Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, California. Signed into  effect by UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister and former NPS  superintendent Rear Admiral T. S. Mercer, the memo of understanding  paves the way for a programmatic partnership between the two  institutions.

Areas of possible collaboration include educational, research,  and public service programs cosponsored by the university and the  postgraduate school. The agreement will support both existing  programs and the development of new initiatives.

"This is a wonderful opportunity for both organizations,"  Chancellor Pister stated. "Our collaboration provides increased  potential for students and faculty, and for our shared communities  as well."

Rear Admiral Marsha Evans, superintendent of NPS, added,  "Both schools will benefit. Our programs and faculty can leverage  research and education resources to  achieve more comprehensive goals. We can have a profound impact  upon important multidisciplinary areas, such as the atmospheric and  oceanographic sciences, and in high- performance computing and  communication initiatives."

This agreement helps formalize a sustained effort that has  occurred over the past several years in areas such as developing  complementary curriculum, increasing outreach to K-12 schools, and  contributing to regional economic development. "Oceanography and  electronic engineering are just two of the curricular areas which  have special potential," noted Ronald Henderson, UCSC dean of  graduate studies. "This agreement provides an opportunity for  faculty to develop projects using complementary resources, with  resultant benefits to students at both institutions."

The agreement with NPS is one of several in which the  University of California, Santa Cruz, has participated in recent  months. Other collaborative agreements now in place include those  with the Fort Ord Reuse Authority; California State University,  Monterey Bay; and Monterey Peninsula College.
