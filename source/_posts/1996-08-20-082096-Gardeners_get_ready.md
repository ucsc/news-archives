SANTA CRUZ, CA--Fall is a prime time to plant perennials and  winter vegetables on the Central Coast, and the UC Santa Cruz Farm  will help you get ready by sponsoring the first-ever Fall Plant Sale  on Friday and Saturday, September 6-7. Hours are noon to 6 p.m. on  Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. The sale will take place at  the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High  streets at the base of campus.

The sale will feature an array of some of the Farm's best- selling perennials, including lavenders, penstemon, yarrow,  ornamental oregano, roses, subtropical salvias, lamb's ear, and  ornamental grasses. A broad range of vegetables will also be  available in six-packs, including broccoli, salad mix, head lettuce,  kale, and chard. All plants are organically grown.

"Fall is the best time to plant perennials on the Central Coast  because the plants get started while the days are still relatively  long and temperatures are relatively warm," explains UCSC  greenhouse manager Christof Bernau. "You may have to water your  plants a few times before the rains come, but by spring they'll be  established and acclimated and ready to take off when the weather  dictates. A little effort now really pays off by the spring, when  you'll have much more substantial plants."

Some vegetables, including lettuce, that usually have a two- or  three-week harvest period in the summer after becoming fully  mature, will produce for two to three months during the winter,  notes Bernau. The Farm specializes in native plants suited to the  Central Coast's Mediterranean climate, offering a lot of color and  show without a lot of water or care, he adds.

Sponsored by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food  Systems, the sale will benefit the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological  Horticulture. Members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden will  receive a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be  available at the sale. For more information about the Fall Plant  Sale or the Friends of the Farm & Garden, call 459-4140.
