**Openings Available For Campus And Community Families**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Beginning July 1, Child Development Centers of  Campbell will assume operation of the campus-affiliated child care  center located in the Granary building at the base of campus.

Child Development Centers (CDC) is a private nonprofit child  care agency established in 1969. The agency operates a variety of  child care programs in California for infants, preschoolers, and  school-aged children. Many of the agency's preschool programs are  accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young  Children.

CDC was selected by a campus committee to run the child care  center following a competitive proposal process. CDC replaces the  Walnut Avenue Women's Center, which ran the child care center for  the previous three years. The center will operate under the new  name of Granary Child Development Center. The center now has full- and part-time openings for preschool  and kindergarten-aged children. The program is designed to serve up  to 42 children of staff, faculty, students, and community members.  The program will be staffed by experienced, state-certified  teachers with a 1 to 6 adult/child ratio for children aged 2 1/2 to 4  and a 1 to 8 ratio for children aged 4 to 6. The Granary Child  Development Center's programs are based on an age-appropriate  curriculum that emphasizes a planned learning environment and  small-group activities.

The center is open from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through  Friday. Various fee schedules are available, with full-time monthly  fees set at $525 for faculty and staff; $270 for students; and $625  for community. For more information, contact the Granary Child  Development Center at (408) 426-3831.
