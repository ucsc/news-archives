SANTA CRUZ, CA--Eleven science students at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, have received $5,000 scholarships from the  Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation. The  students were honored today (November 6) at a ceremony in San  Francisco.

Now in its 24th year of awarding scholarships, the northern  California chapter of the ARCS Foundation awarded nearly $500,000  to about 80 graduate and undergraduate students at eight  universities in the region for the 1996-97 academic year. UCSC's  winners are as follows:
* Krista Clements worked on biodiversity conservation while  earning a master's degree at the University of Georgia. She is now  studying writing in UCSC's Science Communication Program.
* David Dahle, a senior, majors in both computer engineering and  physics. His interests include computer architecture, algorithms,  the theory of hardware testing, and hardware design.
* Jeremy Heyl is pursuing a Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics.  He has published several papers on mergers of colliding galaxies and  galaxy formation, and he now studies neutron stars.
* Jonathan Knight, a student in the Science Communication  Program, has a Ph.D. in molecular biology from UC Berkeley. His  dissertation focused on gene regulation in viruses.
* Lynn Fong Lee, a senior in chemistry and biochemistry, is a  Regents' Scholar and an officer in the Alpha Phi Omega service  organization. She hopes to work in the pharmaceutical industry.
* Kimberley Marcellini is exploring the relationship between  protein structure and function as a senior in chemistry and  biochemistry. Her goal is a chemistry Ph.D., focusing in biomedicine.
* Camille Mojica earned a Ph.D. in integrative biology from UC  Berkeley before enrolling in the Science Communication Program.  She studied the evolution of behavior in freshwater fish.
* Laura Moore is in the fourth year of her Ph.D. program in earth  sciences. Her research concerns coastal issues, such as shoreline  erosion, saltwater intrusion, and the impacts of seawalls.
* Eric Rice, a senior in computer science, is helping to develop a  new parallel processor. A hybrid algorithm he devised will form the  core of the processor's basic mathematics library.
* Kendall Smith III is working toward his Ph.D. in physics, with a  specialty in geophysical fluid dynamics. He is particularly  interested in the regional-scale dynamic flows of pollutants.
* Tracy Washburn came to the Science Communication Program  from the University of Notre Dame, where she received a Ph.D. in  biology. Her work probed the immune systems of mice.

The ARCS Foundation was established in 1958 in Los Angeles.  It is now a national nonprofit organization providing support for top  college science students throughout the country.
