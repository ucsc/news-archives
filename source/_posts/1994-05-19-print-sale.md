SANTA CRUZ, CA--Hundreds of original prints by student artists in  the printmaking department at the University of California, Santa  Cruz, will be on sale at the Twentieth Annual Print Sale on Friday,  June 10, in the Seminar Room at the Elena Baskin Visual Arts  Studios. Hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.

Hand-printed lithographs, etchings, woodblock prints, linoleum  cuts, and monotypes will be featured. Most works are printed in  small editions, and some are one-of-a kind prints. Some artist's  proofs will also be available. Subject matter ranges from abstract  to representational, in both black-and-white and color.

Prices will range from $10 to $100, with most prints marked  between $25 and $40, says Janice Bridgman, a senior technician  with the Board of Studies in Art. Students receive 75 percent of  proceeds from the sale; 25 percent goes to the print studio for  special projects and to cover the cost of advertising the sale.

Artists will be available to answer questions about  printmaking techniques and particular artworks. For more  information, call (408) 459-2887.
