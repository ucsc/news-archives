## UC Santa Cruz Offers New Class On Medicinal Herbs

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A weekend intensive class on medicinal herbs is being offered this month by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Herbs for the Gardener will take place on September 19-20 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day.

Join aspiring herbalist Darren Huckle, a graduate of the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, to learn about gardening with medicinal herbs. Many common herbal remedies can be successfully grown, prepared, and used by the home gardener. There are also many herbs that commonly appear in local gardens. This class will focus on the basics of garden-based herbal medicine, including medicinal plant identification, preparing and planting herb beds, cultural requirements of common herbs, and making medicines from the garden. The first day of class will meet at the Gatehouse on the UCSC Farm, and the second day at local herbalist Christopher Hobb's Living Farmacy in Bonny Doon. There will be a potluck lunch on both days.

The fee is $60 for the general public; $50 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden. Class enrollment is limited; preregistration and payment are due by September 11. A limited number of work-trade positions will be available.
