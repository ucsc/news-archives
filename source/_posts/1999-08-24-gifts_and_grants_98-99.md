## UCSC Receives $18.5 Million In Private Gifts, Grants For 98-99 Year

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California, Santa Cruz, received nearly $18.5 million in private support in the form of gifts and grants during the fiscal year that ended June 30, according to the campus's Development Office. It marked the third consecutive year the campus has received record-breaking levels of private gift support.

"Once again, the excellence of our programs in the arts, sciences, and humanities has been recognized by increased private philanthropic support," said Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "These dramatic increases are the direct result of the hard work of friends of the campus, our faculty and staff, and the deepening involvement in our campus of our alumni."

This year's fund-raising total was 4.5 percent more than that received the previous year, when $17.7 million was contributed to campus programs, scholarships, and fellowships.

Fund-raising was marked by the successful closing of three campuswide capital campaigns. A campaign for the Seymour Marine Discovery Center raised $6.4 million; the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards Program reached its goal of building a $5.2 million endowment; and a campaign to support UCSC's music program raised nearly $1.1 million.

"Completing these key campaigns helps us realize the enormous potential we have to benefit the residents of our local, regional, and international communities," said Ronald P. Suduiko, vice chancellor for University Relations. "These private gifts are critical to the success of our mission and enable us to realize the enormous educational and research potential of UCSC."

Nancy V. Loshkajian, executive director of development, provided an overview of the gifts received this past year. One of the areas of campus that benefited from private gifts was UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering. The Applied Sciences Building was renamed the Jack Baskin Engineering Building to honor Jack Baskin, who has donated nearly $7 million during his lifetime to establish and support the school, including $525,000 this past year. A gift from Narinder Kapany also established the Narinder Singh Kapany Chair in Optoelectronics at the engineering school.

In addition, the Division of Social Sciences broke its own fund-raising records, taking in $4 million to support its programs--nearly three times the funding it had received the previous year.

Alumni gave approximately $932,000 to the campus in 1998-99, an increase of nearly 22 percent over the previous year. Gifts included more than $200,000 in reunion giving from four alumni classes. Annual Giving contributions--primarily consisting of support from alumni and parents and matching funds from corporations--totaled $1.4 million, a 16 percent increase over the previous fiscal year.

The bulk of the funding this past year came from the following sources: foundations, 50 percent; individuals other than alumni and parents, 18 percent; the business sector, 16 percent; alumni and parents, 8 percent. Other sources included institutions and community and campus organizations.

Major private gifts or grants received by UCSC during the past year included:

\-- A $17.7 million grant from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation of Los Altos, to be shared by UCSC and three other leading marine-research institutions: UC Santa Barbara, Stanford University, and Oregon State University. The grant established the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans.

\-- A $1.5 million gift from Helen and Sanford Diller to the Humanities Division, establishing the Helen and Sanford Diller Family Endowment in Jewish Studies. The gift will support and expand UCSC's interdisciplinary program focusing on modern Jewish history, life, and cultures.

\-- A $165,000 gift from John and Billie Mahaney to establish the Mahaney Endowment for Music Education, supporting music instruction in Santa Cruz public schools.
