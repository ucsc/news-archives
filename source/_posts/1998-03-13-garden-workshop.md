SANTA CRUZ, CA--Get ready for the spring gardening season by attending a  free two-hour workshop on Saturday, March 28, from 10 A.M. to noon at San  Lorenzo Lumber's Garden Center, 235 River Street, in Santa Cruz.

Albie Miles, a gardening instructor and graduate of the UCSC Farm & Garden's apprenticeship program, will discuss basic organic gardening  techniques, focusing on spring crops that thrive in the Monterey Bay region.

Miles will introduce the "French intensive" raised-bed gardening method  that helps backyard gardeners get the most production from their garden  space. He'll discuss what to look for in a soil test and ways to improve soil  fertility with compost and other organic amendments. For gardeners  interested in growing their own starts, Miles will offer advice on home- scale propagation techniques, including seed starting, seedling care, and  transplanting.

Spring is the prime time to plant peas, lettuces, spinach, carrots, salad  mix, beets, and potatoes, and Miles will review the optimum sowing and  transplanting dates for these popular crops. He'll also help gardeners select  varieties that are proven winners in the local area, and there will be plenty  of time for questions. Handouts on sowing schedules for Santa Cruz, mail  order and seed catalogs, Web sites for gardeners, and other free information  will also be available.

Sponsored by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems  and the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden, the workshop will be valuable  for novice gardeners and pros alike.
