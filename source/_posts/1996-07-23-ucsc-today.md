SANTA CRUZ, CA--Radio listeners who tune their dials to KZSCÂ¯88.1 FM at noon on Mondays will hear something different  these days, sandwiched between Celtic music in the morning and the  "Soul Kitchen" in the afternoon: "UCSC Today," an hour of lunchtime  conversation about the diverse people and programs that weave the  fabric of UC Santa Cruz.

Hosted by the station's broadcast adviser, Kimberley Monari  Jeannette, "UCSC Today" kicked off June 17 and will run at least  through the end of September. Guests to date have included former  Chancellor Karl S. Pister, director of admissions J. Michael  Thompson, and Paul Whitworth, artistic director of Shakespeare  Santa Cruz. On deck during the next few weeks are the coordinators  of the annual "Dickens Universe" summer conference on Charles  Dickens (July 29), Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood (August 5), and  astronomers from UCSC's Lick Observatory (August 12).

"Our vision for the show is to spotlight the UCSC community,  both for people who are familiar with the campus and for those who  may not know what UCSC is all about," says Monari Jeannette. "We  plan to feature student organizations, alumni, and faculty and staff  who are involved in any number of fabulous projects."

Because KZSC is the university's radio station, Monari  Jeannette adds, the program also provides a training ground for  student interns. "Our purpose is to train students in programming  and station management," she says. "Students will have the  opportunity to work on 'UCSC Today' by scheduling guests, doing on-air interviews, and providing technical assistance."

KZSC, a noncommercial radio station, runs under the auspices  of Student Organization Advising and Resources at UCSC. Its  broadcasts are heard throughout Santa Cruz and Monterey counties  and in parts of San Benito and Santa Clara counties. A committee of  three students and one community member meets at the beginning of  each academic quarter to determine the station's programming  schedule. The fall quarter, when the schedule for "UCSC Today" may  change, starts at the end of September.

Listeners are invited to call KZSC during the program to ask  questions of Monari Jeannette's guests. The studio line is (408) 459-4036.
