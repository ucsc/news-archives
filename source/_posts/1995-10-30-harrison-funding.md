title: Book-In-Progress On Composer Lou Harrison Receives NEH Funding
author: Barbara McKenna

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Leta Miller and Fredric Lieberman, both professors  of music at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have received a  $51,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to  support their work on a book on composer Lou Harrison. In addition,  Miller received a prestigious NEH summer stipend to work on the  project last spring.

Harrison, 78, is widely recognized as one of America's most  inventive contemporary composers. A resident of Aptos, California,  since 1953, he has composed more than 100 works for both western  and eastern instruments. The San Francisco Symphony has performed  two of Harrison's works this fall--a commissioned piece to open the  1995 season and a symphony in October. Harrison is also an  accomplished artist, poet, and calligrapher.

Although a great deal of Harrison's music has been published  and recorded, a biography has yet to be written and only one  analytical study of his music exists. Miller and Lieberman are  collaborating to fill the void. According to Miller, "The book is in  part biographical, but more importantly, it studies the ideas that  have motivated Lou during his long creative life."

The two have conducted nearly thirty hours of interviews with  Harrison and spoken with more than two dozen people who have  known him during the last half century. Among the topics they will  cover are the development of the percussion orchestra, instrument  building, tuning and intonation systems, Asian music and the growth  of the American gamelan orchestra, music and dance, politics and  music, compositional processes, musical aesthetics, music  criticism, and Harrison's contributions to poetry and visual arts.

The $51,000 grant will support travel expenses for additional  interviews, supply purchases, and work by a graduate research  assistant and an administrative assistant.

Miller is a musicologist and flutist who has researched and  written on the music of the Renaissance and Baroque eras. She is  featured in numerous recordings of modern and Baroque music,  including three recordings of works by Harrison.

Lieberman is an ethnomusicologist and a composer who has  researched and written about a range of music from Chinese tonal to  American pop. He has known Harrison since 1963, when, as a  graduate student, he performed in the premiere of Harrison's  "Pacifika Rondo" at the University of Hawaii.
