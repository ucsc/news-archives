![\[Photo of town hall meeting\]][1] Approximately 70 people attended the Millennium Committee's town hall meeting on March 5.

What principles should UCSC follow as the campus moves into the next century? That's the question the Millennium Committee has been asking members of the campus and Santa Cruz communities this academic year.

Charged by Chancellor Greenwood with the responsibility for articulating "key principles that will serve as touchstones for all campus planning into the 21st century," the committee shared some of the answers it has received at a town hall meeting on Thursday, March 5. It also gathered feedback on its work from the audience of 70 at Kresge Town Hall.

"We've been trying to listen to as many segments of the campus community as possible," said Gail Hershatter, a professor of history and cochair of the committee. Hershatter estimates committee members have talked to 500 members of the campus community about their visions for the campus and heard not unanimous agreement, but a "surprising degree" of compatible opinions.

At Thursday's meeting, Hershatter and her cochair, professor of environmental studies Marc Mangel, presented a draft executive summary of the committee's findings. The executive summary, tentatively titled "UCSC at 40-Something," "looks forward 10 to 15 years and asks what kind of a university we want to be," Hershatter said.

In the report, key ideas are grouped under three main headings: "Who we are," "How we work," and "What we do." The section titled "What we do" encompasses ideas for how the campus should produce, transmit, and apply knowledge.

In the committee's vision of UCSC's future, the campus will serve the entire region, including communities in both the San Francisco and Monterey Bay Areas. Enrollment will continue to grow, with graduate student enrollment possibly making up as much as one-third of the expected increase. The campus will continue to focus on providing high-quality undergraduate instruction while carrying out outstanding research.

"Our business is, in a sense, the business of knowledge and how it can be created and transferred," said Mangel. "We believe that research and undergraduate education are not only compatible, but that they reinforce each other."

The following is a sampling of additional principles the committee has identified as being important for the campus into the next century:
* The campus should attract and retain a diverse student body, faculty, and staff.
* Students should be taught a core set of skills that they can transfer wherever they go.
* Written evaluations should be given to every student in a timely manner, even if they fail a course. Faculty should have adequate time to prepare the evaluations built into their schedules. Under the supervision of the sponsoring faculty member, graduate students should write evaluations for students in sections they teach.
* The college system should be strengthened and more faculty encouraged to become involved with specific colleges. First- and second-year students should be given additional avenues in which to interact with faculty through the college system.
* The teaching of writing should be seen as a campuswide responsibility.
* Undergraduate opportunities to participate in research should be expanded.
* An endowment should be developed to help fund graduate student research and perhaps fund resources and services for graduate students.
* More opportunities should be developed for faculty to interact and work together.
* UCSC should continue to reach out to the community around it. Examples might include training community leaders, improving K-12 education, and sending students out to do internships.
* Administrative nimbleness should be enhanced by the establishment of academic and programmatic priorities, the strategic use of resources, and the adjustment of priorities as external conditions change.

The Millennium Committee expects to present a draft report to the campus community by early May and revise it with input from the campus before finalizing it at the end of June. At that time, other committees on campus will take over the task of carrying out the recommendations contained in the report.
