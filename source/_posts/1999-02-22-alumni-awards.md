Constantz is the founder and former president and chief executive officer of Norian Corporation, a company that makes a paste that dramatically speeds the healing of broken bones.

"No one stands up here alone," Lawson said. "I am proudly standing here today representing all the staff who serve our faculty and students in fulfilling UCSC's mission. "Thank you to the Alumni Association for giving me the opportunity to publicly thank those I've been so fortunate to work alongside and grow with all these years." Lawson also recently was named the Woman of the Year for 1998 by the Scotts Valley Chamber of Commerce.
