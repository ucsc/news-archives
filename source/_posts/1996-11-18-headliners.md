The Hubble Space Telescope has unveiled more evidence for "walls" of galaxies at great distances from earth. Astronomer **David Koo, **part of a UCSC team that will use the Keck Telescope for a multiyear survey of 15,000 galaxies, provided perspective on the latest research in the pages of _Science_. And astronomer **Jerry Nelson,** designer of the W. M. Keck Telescopes in Hawaii, discussed with a _Contra Costa Times_ reporter the ambitious plans to upgrade the Keck II Telescope with an "adaptive optics" system, which would counteract the blurring effects of earth's atmosphere.  

_San Francisco Focus_ chose theater arts' **Lawrence Andrews** as one of 40 young and gifted area residents to be profiled in its "Second Annual Brain Trust" story. Andrews's videotapes and installations, exhibited in recent years at such places as the Whitney Museum, San Francisco State University, and the Capp Street Project, are described in the story as "stark, fearless explorations of race, class, and history."  

Sociologist **Monica Casper** was quoted in a _Santa Cruz County Sentinel _story about the grief women experience after having a miscarriage. The _Sentinel_ also tapped **Dan Wirls** of politics for a story about the initiative process in California and **Anthony Pratkanis** of psychology for comment on the mudslinging mess made by state senate candidates Bruce McPherson and Rusty Areias.
