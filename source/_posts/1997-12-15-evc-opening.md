SALARY COMMENSURATE WITH QUALIFICATIONS & EXPERIENCE

The University of California, Santa Cruz invites applications and nominations for the position of Executive Vice Chancellor.  The Executive Vice Chancellor is the chief academic and budget officer of the campus and acts for the Chancellor in the Chancellors absence.  Responsibilities include administrative leadership in planning, coordinating, and implementing academic programs and academic personnel programs; campus operations, including budget preparation, policy development, and allocations for a budget in excess of $235 million; and liaison with the Office of the President and the Academic Senate.  The Executive Vice Chancellor reports to the Chancellor, and advises on all aspects of campus affairs.

This position is an exceptional career opportunity for an individual seeking a leadership role in a nationally-recognized and expanding public research university.  The campus plans growth to at least 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students, from a current enrollment of 10,600 students and 500 faculty FTE. Founded in 1965, the University of California, Santa Cruz is distinguished for combining dedication to teaching excellence at both graduate and undergraduate levels with outstanding achievements in scholarship and research.

In Fall 1997, the campus launched its first professional school, the Jack Baskin School of Engineering.

The University seeks a person of academic distinction with a demonstrated record of accomplishment in academic leadership and management in a research university.  Essential qualifications include a record of sustained excellence in scholarship and teaching, appropriate for a position as full professor in the University of California, experience working effectively in a complex institutional environment, and proven ability to articulate the Universitys goals to both internal and external constituencies.  UC Santa Cruz is strongly committed to diversity in recruiting faculty, students, and staff and in developing its curriculum; the Executive Vice Chancellor is expected to provide leadership in implementing this commitment.
