title: UC Santa Cruz Receives $900,000 Grant For Three-year Project To Improve Girls' Math And Science Education

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Girls and young women are consistently  shortchanged in mathematics and science education by a system that  favors boys and young men, but researchers at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, are launching a major three-year study this  summer to reverse the trend.

Funded by a three-year, $903,000 grant from the National  Science Foundation, the team of UCSC researchers is launching an  ambitious program designed to improve the way mathematics and  science are taught to girls.

"Sex-role stereotypes in school and in the workplace  consistently portray mathematics and science as male domains,"  says Maria Eugenia Matute-Bianchi, an associate professor of  education and anthropology at UCSC and the lead investigator on the  project. "Study after study shows that teachers interact more often  with boys, they praise boys more, and they are more responsive to  male requests for help."

This pattern has a particularly devastating and cumulative  effect on girls' achievement in math and science, where the cultural  stereotypes are already so debilitating, says Matute-Bianchi. The  result is that by the end of secondary school, boys have learned more  math than girls, they are more confident about their problem-solving  abilities, and they are better able to apply what they've learned to  complex problem solving. "The origins of the problem are rooted in  our childrearing practices, cultural expectations, and the schools,"  says Matute-Bianchi. "By shortchanging girls, we are failing to  develop half of the next generation of scientists, engineers, and  technology specialists."

NSF recently awarded a grant of $284,288 to begin the project  this fiscal year, and an additional $619,443 is anticipated over the  life of the study. Totaling $903,731, the NSF funding is among the  largest commitments of support ever received by the Division of  Social Sciences at UCSC.

The project, called Science and Math Equity, or SAME, will  involve students, parents, teachers, and administrators from local  schools in a comprehensive attempt to encourage girls to study and  excel in science and math by making the subjects interesting,  building school and family support, and using innovative classroom  techniques to spark students' enthusiasm. An emphasis will be  placed on reaching girls from underrepresented groups.

The three schools involved in the first year of the SAME  project are Bay View Elementary School, Mission Hill Junior High  School, and Santa Cruz High School. The project will move to  additional schools in the county for the second and third years.

Working in partnership with the Santa Cruz County Office of  Education and local schools, the UCSC team will:

* Host a summer mathematics/science/technology workshop  for girls and teachers;
* Establish a peer-mentoring program for girls and a training  program for teachers to help them promote gender equity in  the classroom;
* Sponsor a family math/science workshop in which girls will  engage in hands-on problem-solving activities with  supportive members of their families;
* Offer an algebra course for parents and caregivers to enable  them to help with homework.

Groups of 12 teachers and 60 girls from each of the three  schools will work together with parents and university faculty and  staff members. These teams will focus on problem-solving  activities in an atmosphere that will establish the girls as equal  partners, rather than the traditional adult-child relationship that  places girls in the subordinate role of "helpee." The cooperative  environment is critical to building girls' confidence and self- esteem, says Matute-Bianchi.

The two-week summer workshops being held this month at  UCSC are the first stage of the project. They will be conducted in  English and Spanish and will use Lego/Logo Construction Kits that  integrate mathematics, science, technology, design, and problem  solving. Lego/Logo, which was developed at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, combines Lego blocks and the use of a  simple computer-programming language to allow students to create  and control simple machines that will enable them to explore  subjects such as simple kinematics, robotics, and computer  programming.

Project SAME participants--teachers, students, and  administrators--will share their experiences with peers,  potentially reaching 7,500 students and 400 teachers during the  project.

Ultimately, Matute-Bianchi's team hopes to share its insights  and successes with educators locally and nationally. SAME  participants will work together to analyze the project and to  develop a model that can be replicated elsewhere. "We want to reach  others who are concerned about what's happening to girls in school,"  says Matute-Bianchi.

The UCSC team is made up of Matute-Bianchi; Trish Stoddart,  an associate professor of education; Laurie Edwards, an assistant  professor of education; and Miriam Landesman, a lecturer in  mathematics and economics. They are joined in the project by Nancy  Giberson, assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction in  the Santa Cruz County Office of Education.
