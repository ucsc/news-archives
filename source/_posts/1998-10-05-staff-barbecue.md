Remember to RSVP for the annual Staff Barbecue, which will take place at the East Field on Monday, October 12, from 11:30 to 1:30 p.m.

The barbecue features a variety of picnic foods including burgers, veggie burgers, salads, lemonade, and dessert. The OPERS pool, lockers, and towels will be available for participants to use at no charge during the event.

Staff will be provided release time to participate in the barbecue, but campus offices normally open during the noon hour should remain open.

People who wish to attend the barbecue are requested to RSVP no later than Thursday, October 8, to Jeff Rockwell.

Staff are strongly advised to ride the campus shuttles to the barbecue. Construction taking place on campus is expected to limit the parking available in the East Field lot.
