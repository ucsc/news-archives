SANTA CRUZ, CA--In non-Western countries, the rise of the global economy  has led to an explosion in manufacturing facilities with substandard  working conditions, according to organizers planning a one-day conference  at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The emergence of these so- called "sweatshops," which often rely on child labor, is altering family and  community life in those countries.

Scholars and activists will examine the social problems resulting  from the expansion of the global economy at a forum on campus on  Wednesday, February 25. The forum, "What Price Fashion? The Campaign  Against Global Sweatshops," takes place from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. at the Oakes  College Learning Center on the UCSC campus. It is free and open to the  public.

Mary Beth Pudup, an associate professor of community studies, said  the forum's panel discussions and presentations will help bring "a scholarly  approach to a topic that carries an enormous emotional freight."

UC Santa Cruz faculty, scholars from other universities, and prominent  national activists on the issue of sweatshops will speak at the event.

The forum was organized by the Faculty Labor Action Committee with  support from the Departments of Community Studies, Sociology,  Environmental Studies, and History of Consciousness; the Center for Global,  International, and Regional Studies; and Oakes College, College Eight, and  Merrill College. For more information, call Mary Beth Pudup at (408) 459- 3516 or send e-mail to pudup@cats.ucsc.edu.
