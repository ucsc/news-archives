title: UC Santa Cruz Economists Look To The Future Of Wind Power

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Using a computer program that any IBM or  Macintosh can run, economists at the University of California, Santa  Cruz, have projected a rosy future for wind power in California.

They calculate that within the next 50 years, the price of wind  energy will be almost as low as that of energy from gas-fired  generators. Also, because fossil-fuel shortages are likely in the  coming century, the researchers believe that wind power ultimately  will take over 8 to 18 percent of the energy market in the state.  Californians now use wind-driven generators for 2 to 3 percent of  their energy needs--about enough to run all the lights and appliances  in the city of San Francisco.

The wind-power model is the work of Ph.D. student James Hay,  research associate George Hoffman, and professor of economics  Nirvikar Singh. The team completed its calculations recently with  the aid of a grant from the University of California Energy Institute,  a nine-campus research group founded in 1980.

Three main prognostications contributed to the model's  optimistic forecast for wind energy: future mass-produced  machinery will cost less; new wind turbines will be better and  faster; and manufacturers and managers of wind-power operations  will really get the knack of it over time. These projections are  grounded in real-world examples like the semiconductor industry,  which took off once the demand for products fueled the fire of  manufacturing. "Wind power is still somewhat of an infant industry,"  says Hoffman, "but we're on the threshold of a change."

Power from the wind is not a new idea. The Persians employed  breeze-driven grain mills around 1500 b.c. However, until recently,  windmills were relatively rare and solitary beasts, garnering more  attention for their scenic value than for their energy potential.  Attitudes changed during the energy crunch of 1973. Suddenly,  utility companies jumped to find alternatives to endangered oil and  gas. Even so, wind power stood like a neglected debutante on the  sidelines of the energy scene. "Wind energy was looked at as  something weird and way out--a California thing," says Singh. "Now  that stigma is disappearing."

Wind energy offers several advantages over more traditional  power sources. Most importantly, it is renewable. Fossil fuels are  millions of years in the making, and they're gone with the flash of a  stove burner or the turn of a car key. Wind blows every day of the  year. Also, there are no toxic side effects. Hoffman contrasts this  with the fearful dangers of nuclear power: "Wind energy lacks that  potential for mass disaster," he says. Hoffman also points out that  wind power is "a more flexible technology." As he says: "You can  install one turbine at a time instead of a power plant at a time. It's  months versus years."

But even wind has its costs. Most people think the huge spindly  propellers and iron skeletons of modern turbines are a blot on the  landscape. Turbines often come in phalanxes of several thousand, as  at Altamont Pass near Livermore, so they can hardly be overlooked.  And, if humans find them ugly, birds find them deadly. Hundreds of  eagles, hawks, and kestrels fly into whirring turbine blades every  year. Researchers at UC Davis are now working out ways to cut down  on the death toll using noisemakers on the towers and orange stripes  on the propellers.

Despite these costs, the UCSC team stands by wind power as a  feasible and benevolent source of energy. They believe that power  companies will become increasingly interested in it, because "for  them, it is like an insurance policy," says Singh. When other sources  of energy dwindle, wind will always be around.

"There is a lot of wind potential out there," says Joseph  Hughes, a senior research associate at Pacific Gas and Electric, "but  it's in a horse race with other types of fuel." He believes it unlikely  that wind power will take a big share of the market as long as oil  and gas prices stay low. The problem with wind, he says, is that it  varies from day to day. On the very hottest days in California, when  residents are mopping their brows and revving up their air  conditioners, wind turbines limp to a halt in the still sultry air.  Energy can be stored from brisker, breezier days, but not very  efficiently.

According to the new wind-power model, this will be less of a  problem with advanced turbine designs. Moreover, if the calculations  are correct, fossil fuels will eventually lose the horse race as world  supplies run down.

The team at UCSC is not the first to design an economic model  for wind power, but they say their work offers a new advantage in  that anyone can use it--not just those with a Ph.D. in economic  theory. The model uses Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software and  can run on any personal computer. "We've got something accessible  here," says Singh. The researchers plan to make diskettes available  to others in the field.

The other benefit of their computer projection, Singh says, is  that researchers can update it every year with current data, thus  making it responsive to economic ebbs and flows. This flexibility  should make the model valuable for many years to come.
