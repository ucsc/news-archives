SANTA CRUZ, CA--This summer more than 200 high school and  college minority students are attending programs at the University  of California, Santa Cruz, designed to encourage them to continue  their academic careers.

Four programs, running as late as September 3, are offered by  UCSC's Student Affirmative Action/Educational Opportunity  Programs (SAA/EOP). The programs are geared for four very  different kinds of students--from high school juniors to college  seniors, from those focusing on intensive research to those just  trying to get acquainted with the university. Many participants are  the first in their families to have an opportunity to attend college or  graduate school.

"Participants in the summer programs learn about their  educational options and acquire essential skills that will help them  succeed at the university and graduate levels," explains SAA/EOP  director Allen Fields.

The summer programs offer participants a glimpse of  academic life. For the younger students, this means experiencing  residential life on campus and getting a taste of the rigors of  university academics. For the older students the summer is a chance  to work closely with a faculty member on a research project, to  strengthen academic skills, and to learn what is required if they  decide to continue their studies.

The summer programs--Summer Opportunities for Academic  Research (SOAR), the Summer Bridge Program, the Math and Science  Academy, and the Summer Science Honors Institute--are  continuations of programs offered by SAA/EOP during the academic  year.

SAA/EOP begins outreach into area schools in the seventh  grade through the Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP). "Early  Academic Outreach gives students a relationship with the  university, which makes the campus more accessible and less  intimidating. Students learn what they need to do to be admitted to  the university and begin to think in terms of continuing their  education," explains Michelle Handy, Central Coast coordinator of  EAOP and supervisor of the weeklong Math and Science Academy.

The outreach continues once students enroll at UCSC through  the Pre-Graduate Program and other SAA/EOP programs. "We provide  support through workshops and tutorials offered in our Learning  Center, through academic and peer counseling, through the Faculty  Mentorship Program, and the Graduate Information Program," says  Rosalee Cabrera, coordinator of Academic Support Services and  Programs at SAA/EOP.

The summer programs vary in length from one to eight weeks,  but even the shortest covers a lot of territory--offering workshops,  seminars, social functions, talks with guest speakers, counseling  from SAA/EOP staff, and mentorship from faculty, staff, and UCSC  students.

**The programs are:**

* SOAR (Summer Opportunities for Academic Research) June 28-August 1  20 to 24 UCSC juniors and seniors Nonresidential

"Through SOAR, we identify underrepresented students who  have the potential and the interest in pursuing graduate studies and  are preparing to become faculty," says Cabrera. Students do research  under the supervision of a faculty mentor, attend workshops on  graduate careers and on applying to graduate school, and present  papers at the end of the session in a research colloquium. The  program is supported in part by a grant from the U.S. Department of  Education.

* Summer Bridge Program July 9-August 13 100 incoming first-year students Residential (Crown College)

The aim of Summer Bridge is to help students make the  transition from high school to college. Summer Bridge students  engage in five weeks of intensive course work, participate in  workshops, and learn about a variety of resources at UCSC.

* Math and Science Academy August 7-13 60 eleventh graders from the Central Coast and San Joaquin Valley Residential (Crown College)

Students who have been identified through SAA/EOP's Early  Academic Outreach Program (EAOP) spend a week on campus,  attending classes and workshops and living in residence halls. "The  focus of the academy is on math and science enrichment, essay  writing, social and cultural enrichment, and college preparation,"  says Handy.

* Summer Science Honors Institute August 13-September 3 20 incoming first-year students Residential (Oakes College)

A new program for high-achieving students (with a 3.5 GPA or  better) to orient them to resources on campus and to course work in  the sciences. During their three-week stay, students will take field  trips to area laboratories, attend math and science seminars, and  receive career counseling. The program is co-sponsored by SAA/EOP  and the Division of Natural Sciences.
