**Three-Year Teacher-training Project Will Help Bridge The Cultural Gap Between Teachers And Increasingly Diverse Students**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Dramatic demographic changes have transformed  the makeup of students in California classrooms, where more than  one-fifth of K-12 students have limited English skills. Although  Spanish remains the most prevalent language other than English, it  is becoming more common for instructors to be faced with the  challenge of teaching students who speak Vietnamese, Hmong,  Cantonese, Khmer, Tagalog, Korean, or Armenian.

In 1990, there was an estimated shortage of more than 14,000  qualified bilingual teachers, according to the California Department  of Education. Yet the majority of new teachers continue to be  monolingual English-speaking non-Hispanic whites, creating a  "cultural mismatch" between California's students and the teachers  who serve them, says Trish Stoddart, associate professor of  education at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

"The challenge for us in this state is to prepare teachers who  can meet the needs of culturally and linguistically diverse students,  including students in both bilingual and multilingual classrooms,"  says Stoddart. "How do teachers who only speak English make the  academic content of mathematics, science, English, and other  subjects accessible to second-language learners?"

Stoddart is the lead researcher on a three-year $1.25 million  federal grant UCSC has received to help teachers develop  instructional strategies and theoretical perspectives to meet the  needs of culturally and linguistically diverse student populations.  The grant will fund the California Center for Teacher Development  (CCTD), and participants will work to improve teacher preparation-- in part by evaluating what actually works best in K-12 classrooms.  Participants will also provide support for new teachers during their  first two years in the classroom. Stoddart's UCSC collaborators are  Ellen Moir, director of teacher education and the Santa Cruz New  Teacher Project/Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment  Program, and Stephanie Dalton, associate director of the National  Center for Research on Cultural Diversity and Second Language  Learning. The project is funded by the Eisenhower Professional  Development Federal Activities Program.

Joining UCSC in this endeavor are California State University,  Monterey Bay, the California Department of Education, the  Commission on Teacher Credentialing, and the Santa Cruz and  Monterey County Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment  Projects. The collaborators hope to create a model program of  teacher development that links minority recruitment, teacher  training, and ongoing support of beginning and experienced teachers.

"Since 1992, teachers in California have been required to  receive special training for students who are learning to speak  English, but little is known about how effective those changes have  been," says Stoddart. The first step for CCTD is to assess what  teacher education programs are currently doing to prepare educators  for culturally diverse classrooms--an endeavor that Stoddart will  oversee.

The CCTD will also launch a field-based program of  "professional development schools" similar in some ways to medical  training programs, says Stoddart. "Most medical schools have very  strong research programs, and they also have teaching hospitals  where medical students learn cutting-edge skills from practicing  physicians and researchers," says Stoddart. "Similarly, we want to  integrate educational theory with models of exemplary practice, so  we'll be working with these professional development schools where  excellent teachers are developing practices that we can use in  teacher training. We'll do most of our research at the school sites in  real classrooms."

Ultimately, the CCTD will capture the most effective  classroom strategies on CD-ROM or video for distribution to teacher  credentialing programs. "Students from different cultures have  different patterns of language and discourse and social interaction.  We want to be able to give beginning teachers some examples of  what good teaching looks like," says Stoddart. Samples of student  work and curriculum materials could be shared in the same manner,  she notes.

Participating in CCTD will be a round table of faculty members  from the teacher education programs at each of the UC campuses as  well as the California State University campuses in Chico, Monterey  Bay, Northridge, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Francisco, San  Jose, and Stanislaus. The center's materials will be developed with  input from those faculty and will be field-tested in their courses as  well as in classrooms where student teachers are getting their first  hands-on experience, says Stoddart.

"We're taking knowledge generated by basic research on  learning and translating it into practical models and teacher  education materials," says Stoddart.
