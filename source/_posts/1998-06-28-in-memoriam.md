**Peter Careaga,** a senior reproduction graphics technician in Printing Services, died May 28 of leukemia; he was 28. Described by his coworkers as a very dedicated employee, Peter Careaga worked at UCSC for three years and was attending Cabrillo College.

**Barbara Sheriff,** a longtime UCSC staff member, died June 15 in Santa Cruz of cancer; she was 73. Shortly after her graduation from UCLA in 1946, Ms. Sheriff took a job at that campus working as a writer and an administrative assistant. In 1961 she was asked by Dean McHenry to come to Santa Cruz to be his assistant at the new campus, where she served a succession of chancellors until her retirement in 1981. Ms. Sheriff was instrumental in founding the UCSC Affiliates, and in her retirement, she was active in the University Women's Club and the Arboretum Associates.

**John Wadhams,** an associate construction inspector, died June 20 of cancer; he was 57. A 40-year resident of Santa Cruz, Mr. Wadhams had worked for 25 years as an electrician before he came to work at UCSC in 1989. As an example of the high regard in which he was held by his fellow employees, dozens of UCSC staff from all corners of the campus (led by senior inspector Bob Wilt) participated in reroofing his house last fall after his illness was diagnosed and he was forced to take a leave of absence. Mr. Wadhams was very active in his church and volunteered with the Homeless Garden Project.
