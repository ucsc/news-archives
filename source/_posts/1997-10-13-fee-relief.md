In signing AB 1318, Gov. Wilson has provided added relief to University of California students and their families. For the last three years, with the support of the governor and the Legislature, fee levels at UC have remained steady. We can now look to a reduction in 1998-99 in general fees for our undergraduate students who are California residents and a freeze for two years on general fees for California residents enrolled in our graduate and professional school programs. We have been assured that state funding will be provided to compensate for the loss in revenue resulting from the reduction in fees. The enactment into law of AB 1318 affirms California's commitment to maintaining the affordability of public higher education, a commitment shared wholeheartedly by the University of California. We are extremely grateful to the governor, to Assemblywoman Ducheny for authoring the bill, to Lt. Gov. Gray Davis for his leadership of this effort and to the Legislature for its strong bipartisan support of this measure.

Richard C. Atkinson   
President   
University of California
