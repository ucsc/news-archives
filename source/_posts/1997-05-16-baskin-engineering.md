**Focus Will Be On The High-technology Needs Of The Region And The  State In The Next Century**

SAN JOSE, CA--With its distinctive new School of Engineering,  finalized yesterday (May 15) before the University of California  Board of Regents, UC Santa Cruz is poised to assume a critical role  in training the skilled engineering workforce that will drive the  economies of Silicon Valley, the Monterey Bay region, and the state  in the 21st century.

Instruction will begin in September for freshmen in electrical  engineering, the first of several new degree programs that will join  existing strong departments in computer engineering and computer  science to comprise UCSC's first professional school. Studies have  shown that California will need increasing numbers of proficient  engineers in these fields to remain at the vanguard of the high-technology global marketplace.

Faculty hiring is also under way in the key discipline of  applied and engineering mathematics, the second of the new  programs. The school's planners envision future programs in at least  three other areas of growing importance: software engineering,  engineering management, and molecular biotechnology engineering.

Ultimately, plans call for the School of Engineering to grow to  about 90 faculty, 500 graduate students, and 1,200 undergraduates \--significant expansions from the current totals of 24 faculty, 160  graduate students, and 320 undergraduates.

"The new School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz is both timely  and advantageous to the state," said UC President Richard C.  Atkinson. "The campus has carefully planned the school and its  programs to place UCSC on the cutting edge of intellectual  developments and the application of new knowledge, as well as to  address clear societal needs. The school represents another  important step as the University of California seeks to continue to  meet and anticipate the needs of students and the state."

UCSC's expansion of its engineering programs also received a  huge boost today with the announcement of a $5 million gift from  Santa Cruz philanthropist and retired developer and engineer Jack  Baskin, for whom the school will be named (see separate news  release). The gift is the largest private donation in the campus's  history.

Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood presented UCSC's plans to the  Board of Regents yesterday and accepted Baskin's gift at a news  conference today in San Jose. These developments, plus a  commitment of $2 million in funding over the next four years from  the UC Office of the President, will allow the campus to proceed  without delay toward its ambitious goals, Greenwood said.

"The Jack Baskin School of Engineering will foster innovative  and entrepreneurial research, both by the faculty members we will  recruit and by the students we will educate," Greenwood said. "By  focusing on several targeted areas of excellence, we believe that our  engineers and computer scientists will become creative and  important contributors to the economy of our future."

Several factors, said Greenwood, will make UCSC's School of  Engineering stand out:
* Close partnerships with industry. As the University of  California's service provider for Silicon Valley and the burgeoning  high-tech community in the Monterey Bay region, UCSC has worked  closely with industry leaders to gauge their needs and chart the  course for its new school.
* Linkages with other area engineering programs. UCSC's  offerings will complement those at UC Berkeley, Stanford, San Jose  State University, and Santa Clara University through joint research  and education, sharing of facilities, and other collaborative efforts.
* The Santa Cruz educational experience. Synergistic ties  with UCSC's first-rate departments of environmental studies,  economics, biology, chemistry and biochemistry, earth sciences, and  ocean sciences will offer unique opportunities for young engineers  to apply their skills. Further, UCSC's traditional emphasis on a well- rounded liberal arts education will help prepare graduates for the  human aspects, as well as the technical challenges, of their jobs.

Patrick Mantey, Jack Baskin Professor of Computer Engineering  at UCSC and dean designate of the School of Engineering, looks  forward to the fruition of the campus's long-standing plans. Indeed,  the UC Board of Regents first approved a School of Engineering at  UCSC in 1966, one year after the campus opened. Those plans, plus an  updated proposal in 1991, were shelved until now for budgetary  reasons.

"We are fulfilling our dream that UCSC can become a much  more important player in the regional economy," Mantey said. "We  will also become a more mature and diverse UC campus in terms of  our academic offerings and the students we are likely to attract."  Already, Mantey noted, applications to engineering and computer  science at UCSC have increased 17 percent and 34 percent,  respectively, since the campus announced its preliminary plans last  fall.

Greenwood and Mantey also foresee close links between the  School of Engineering and the UC Monterey Bay Education, Science,  and Technology (MBEST) Center, a research and technology park that  UCSC is developing in Marina at the site of the former Fort Ord  military base. MBEST tenants will draw upon the expertise of nearly  two dozen research and educational institutions in the Monterey Bay  Research Crescent to study issues relating to information  technology, environmental science, biotechnology, and other fields.
