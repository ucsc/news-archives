Student Health Services is offering annual influenza shots in anticipation of the flu season. The drop-in program starts Monday, October 19. From Monday through Thursday, students, faculty, and staff may stop by Room 152 of the Cowell Student Health Center between 9 and 10 a.m. to receive their shots.

The $10 fee for the vaccination must be paid on the day of service.

Student Health Services encourages people who are in high-risk groups to get a flu shot either at their private physician's office or at the health center. Some off-campus vaccination sites are posted at the front of the health center. Supplies of the influenza vaccine are limited.

High-risk groups include persons:
* 65 or older
* with cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, including asthma
* who live in nursing homes or care facilities housing patients with chronic disease
* with chronic metabolic diseases, including diabetes and renal disease, which have required medical follow-up in the past year
* capable of infecting those in high-risk categories, such as professional or home care givers, nursing home staff, or household members of high-risk groups
* with weakened immune systems
* living in close quarters, such as residence halls, to minimize the risk of illness in case of a flu outbreak
