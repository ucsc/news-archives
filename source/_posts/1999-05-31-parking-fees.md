title: Parking Permit Prices Rise For 1999-2000

The cost of bringing a car onto campus will rise for the 1999-2000 year, according to Transportation and Parking Services.

"A," "B," and "C" permits will rise from $32 to $42 a month--an increase of $120 per year--effective July 1. Motorcycle and remote permit fees will also increase: Remote permits will rise by $5 per month, from $16 to $21; motorcycle permits will increase by $3.50 per month, from $10.50 to $14.

Vanpool fees, temporary permits, and "scratch-off" permits will remain the same.

"We are sensitive to the fact that this is a substantial increase in parking fees," said Jan Tepper, chief of UCSC's Police Department, which oversees TAPS. "TAPS is being asked to fund many new projects that will increase on-campus parking and develop many forms of alternative transportation."

Included in these projects would be the possible construction of the parking structure and expansion of remote parking, continuation of attendant parking programs, improvements to transit pullouts, subsidy of vanpool programs, and funding for many other alternative transportation programs, Tepper said.

Employees in the Clerical (CX), Residual Patient Care Technical (HX), and Academic Senate (A7) bargaining units will not be affected by the parking fee changes until such time agreements regarding parking fees are reached between the university and the organizations, which exclusively represent employees in these bargaining units. Until then, 1997-98 fees will apply. Questions may be directed to Labor Relations, (831) 459-2017.
