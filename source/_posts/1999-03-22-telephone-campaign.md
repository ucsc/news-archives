title: Admissions Prepares For Fourth Telephone Campaign&#59; Volunteers Needed
author: UCSC Currents
---

The Office of Undergraduate Admissions is coordinating the fourth annual UC Santa Cruz Welcomes event--a telephone outreach campaign targeting newly admitted underrepresented freshmen and transfer students. The goal of the event is to increase campus diversity by providing admitted students with information regarding the breadth of the academic, residential, and student support resources available at UCSC.

Last year, approximately 120 campus volunteers logged a total of more than 2,500 calls. With the number of admitted underrepresented students higher this year, campus volunteers are in even greater demand.

This year, UC Santa Cruz Welcomes is scheduled for eight evenings: April 5-8 and April 12-15, from 5 to 9 each evening.

If you would like to participate in this year's campaign, please contact Daniel Moreno, admissions outreach coordinator at (831) 459-4260,  or by e-mail at mija@cats.ucsc.edu. The calls will be made from telephones in the Admissions Evaluation Office at 150 Hahn Student Services. Volunteers will receive a thorough training and...dinner.
