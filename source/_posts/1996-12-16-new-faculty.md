Most recently, she was commissioned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in Los Angeles to collaborate on the design of a new Metro station. Nagasawa earned a B.F.A. from the State Academy of Fine Arts, Netherlands, and an M.F.A. from the Hochschule der Kunste, Germany.

**Donald Smith**

Assistant Professor of Biology

Donald Smith earned his B.A. and Ph.D. from UCSC and his master's degree from Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, San Francisco State University, all in biology. He worked as a toxicologist at the University of Maryland and at UCSC before joining the faculty this year. Smith's research in environmental toxicology concerns the effects of lead and other toxic metals on organisms, including humans. His experiments examine how metals become toxic, the paths metals take through the body and where they are stored, and the effectiveness of treatments for lead poisoning.
