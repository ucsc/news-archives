SANTA CRUZ, CA--Eleven science students at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, have received $5,000 scholarships from the  Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation. The  students were honored today (November 1) at a ceremony in San  Francisco.

Now in its 23rd year of awarding scholarships, the northern  California chapter of the ARCS Foundation awarded $475,000 to 80  students at eight area universities for the 1995-96 academic year.  UCSC's winners are as follows:

Amy Adams of the Science Communication Program has a  master's degree in genetics and received an award at Cornell for her  teaching. Her research concerned development in nematodes.

Dawn Burkhardt, a senior in chemistry, is one of the top  undergraduates in the department. She is interested in biological and  environmental applications of chemistry and plans to earn a Ph.D.

Carol Creasey is a Ph.D. candidate in earth sciences and a  member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. For her research she  analyzes trace metals and other substances in groundwater.

Mary Engle, a graduate student in marine biology, is studying  fur seal pups on the Pribilof Islands of Alaska. She designed an  interactive K-12 educational program at Long Marine Lab.

Mark Herbster is working toward a Ph.D. in computer and  information sciences. He has published his research, on developing  simple on-line learning algorithms, in conference proceedings.

Scott Johnson, a senior in biochemistry, will pursue a Ph.D. in  public health. He works on using DNA as probes and anticancer  agents, and he volunteers for the Santa Cruz Needle Exchange.

Jennifer Jolly is in the marine sciences master's program. She  is studying the foraging of sea otters in Elkhorn Slough, examining  the "decisions" otters make to optimize their efforts.

Beth Martin of the Science Communication Program has worked  as a researcher in plant genetics. Her writing plans focus on  biotechnology, medical research, and genetic engineering.

Barbra Rodriguez-Thomas joined the Science Communication  Program after managing a DNA sequencing group for Monsanto in St.  Louis. She plans to become a full-time science writer.

Natalie Stout-Batalha is nearing completion of her Ph.D. in  astronomy and astrophysics. Her research involves the study of  young stars, which act as snapshots of our sun during its youth.

Gretchen Vogel interned at the Public Affairs Office of  Argonne National Laboratory and is now in the Science  Communication Program. She studied tumor biology as an  undergraduate.

The ARCS Foundation was established in 1958 in Los Angeles.  It is now a national nonprofit organization providing support for top  college science students throughout the country.
