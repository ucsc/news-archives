SANTA CRUZ, CA--The sight of hummingbirds sipping the sweet nectar of  sages is a sure sign that spring has returned to the UC Santa Cruz Farm and  Garden.

The 25-acre organic Farm features gardens, orchards, and fields of  row crops. The smaller Alan Chadwick Garden is a delightful mix of  vegetables, dwarf fruit trees, and rambling roses--all nestled on a hill near  the top of campus.

Spring is a perfect time to visit the Farm and Garden, where apple  trees are blooming, peas are sprouting, and the greenhouses are brimming  with plants. Free one-hour docent-led tours are available each week.  Visitors will learn about growing flowers, fruits, and vegetables  organically, as well as about composting, propagation, and the university's  research in sustainable agriculture.

Tours take place on Thursdays at noon and Sundays at 2 P.M. Tours of  the Alan Chadwick Garden take place on the first Sunday and Thursday of  each month. All other tours take place at the Farm. The Alan Chadwick  Garden is located between Merrill and Stevenson Colleges on the UCSC  campus. The Farm is located above the historic Blacksmith Shop near the  base of campus.

For more information about tours, call 459-3248. For directions, call  459-4140.
