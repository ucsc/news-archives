Admissions specialist and writer **Debra Fay Holton** had one of her creative nonfiction pieces published in _Salon Magazine._ The story, titled "A Nose for Things," appeared in the "Mothers Who Think" department of the online magazine's February issue. In the story, Holton describes her relationship with her first best friend, Janine, one of a long line of friends who would never be able to meet her mother's high standards.

Holton has been writing poems and stories for nearly fifteen years. She was a finalist in the 1998 _Good Times_ 66-word story contest, and she has a short story coming out in the next issue of _Chinquapin._

She will be performing her original work in two upcoming shows: "The Tower of Babel: spoken word on the failure of language," with Patti Sirens, Joya Winwood, and others, at Mad Jack's Coffee House in the East Village Shopping Center, 1505 East Cliff Drive, at 7 p.m., April 17; and "In Celebration of the Muse," with Patrice Vecchione, Maude Meehan, Ellen Bass, and others in a benefit for WomenCare, at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, May 22.
