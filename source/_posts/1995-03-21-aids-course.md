SANTA CRUZ, CA--For the third consecutive year, community  members and health-care professionals are invited to attend AIDS:  Perspectives on an Epidemic, a special series of evening lectures  offered by the Biology Department at UC Santa Cruz. The popular  course will examine the biological, social, and psychological aspects  of AIDS.

Formally known as Biology 80J, the course runs from April 5  through June 7. Lectures will occur on Mondays and Wednesdays from  7 to 8:45 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2, behind the Bay Tree Bookstore at  UCSC. At this time, there are no plans to offer the course next year.

Each lecture will focus on the AIDS pandemic from a different  angle. Planned topics include the state of knowledge about HIV, the  AIDS virus; how AIDS affects women, people of color, and families;  treatment and prevention; and a panel of people with AIDS.  Interested members of the public may attend as many of the lectures  as they choose.

Principal instructors are Henry Hilgard, professor emeritus of  biology, who recently received the Distinguished Teaching Award  from the UCSC Alumni Association; George Wolfe, health officer for  Santa Cruz County; and Terry Cavanagh, HIV prevention coordinator  at UCSC.

Experts in AIDS research and education from throughout  northern California will give guest lectures on about half of the  topics. Speakers in previous years have included Dr. Donald Francis  of the Centers for Disease Control; the late author Randy Shilts; and  Martin Delaney, founder of Project Inform.

"This is an excellent opportunity for laypeople to learn up-to- date information on AIDS from some of the leading experts in this  area," says Cavanagh. "In past years the lectures have been  especially valuable for instructors of biology and health education in  grades 6-12, who need the latest information for their own classes."

For more information about the course, including a flyer that  lists scheduled topics and dates, call Terry Cavanagh at 459-4679.
