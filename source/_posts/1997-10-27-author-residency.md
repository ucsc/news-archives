**Residency Includes Public Talks And Visits To Local High Schools**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Grace Paley, one of America's most revered short story  writers, will come to  the University of California, Santa Cruz, November 3-14 as a UC Regents'  Lecturer. Among the activities planned during Paley's visit are two public  readings and visits with area high school students.

Born in the Bronx in 1922, Paley has become known as a bard of Jewish  New York with such highly acclaimed collections as The Little Disturbances  of Man (1959), Enormous Changes at the Last Minute (1974), and Later the  Same Day (1985). Her most recent work, The Collected Stories, was  published in 1994 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. A new collection of works,  "Just As I Thought," will be published in April 1998.

Paley has received numerous awards and honors, including a  Guggenheim grant, a National Endowment for the Arts grant, an American  Academy Award, and the Edith Wharton Award. She has taught at several  colleges and universities, including Columbia University, Sarah Lawrence  College, Syracuse University, and the City College of New York.

During her time on campus, Paley will guest lecture in classes, meet  with UCSC faculty and students, make presentations at Aptos and Santa Cruz  High Schools, and present two public readings: Friday, November 7, 12:30-2:30  P.M., Santa Cruz Central Library Meeting Room, and Tuesday, November 11, 7  P.M., UCSC, Oakes College, Room 105. The readings are free and open to the  public.

Paley's school visits are presented in conjunction with Creative  Writing in the Schools--an outreach program of the UCSC Literature  Department in which creative writing majors work with high school  students and their teachers.

The UC Regents' Lecturer position was established by the University of  California to bring distinguished men and women--ordinarily from nonacademic  fields--to UC campuses for short residencies. For more information on Paley's  residency, call the Literature Department at (408) 459-4129.
