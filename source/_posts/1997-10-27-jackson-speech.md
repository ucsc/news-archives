Jesse Jackson, who has been in the forefront of the civil rights movement in America for more than 30 years, spoke to a packed house at Stevenson Dining Hall on Tuesday.

President of the National Rainbow Coalition, Jackson came to UCSC as part of his Freedom Bus "Save the Dream" tour. On the tour, Jackson is making stops across California from San Diego to San Francisco and Bakersfield to Sacramento. The tour will culminate in a "Save the Dream" march at the state capitol on Oct. 27.

The talk was sponsored by a number of UCSC organizations, including the African/Black Student Alliance, Asian/Pacific Islander Student Alliance, Movimiento Esudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, Student Alliance of North American Indians, and Stevenson's CAO, council, programs, and Provost Fellow-in Residence Program.
