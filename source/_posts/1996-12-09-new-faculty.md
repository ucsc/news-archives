**Jonathan Fox**

Associate Professor of Latin American and Latino Studies  

Jonathan Fox specializes in Mexican politics and international development policy. Fox has spent several years studying the impact of the World Bank's policies, which were revised in the late 1980s and early 1990s to respond to charges that some of its projects have had devastating social and environmental effects. He comes to UCSC from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was an associate professor of political science. He earned his B.A. in politics at Princeton University and his Ph.D. in political science at MIT.

**Paul Koch**  

Assistant Professor of Earth Sciences  

Paul Koch studies the effects of climate change on animals and plants, using chemical and physical clues from fossils to reconstruct conditions on land from thousands or millions of years ago. He uses similar tools to explore the ecology of modern and fossil land animals, such as elephants. Koch received his B.A. from the University of Rochester in geology and English and his M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in geology. He has worked at the Smithsonian Institution, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and Princeton University.
