SANTA CRUZ--Two women, who half a century ago were caught up in  events that indelibly changed their lives and the world around them,  will speak about their experiences this month at the University of  California, Santa Cruz.

Alice McGrath, now 78, was a member of the defense team for  a 1940s murder case that inspired Luis Valdez's movie and musical  Zoot Suit. Renee Firestone, now 71, was imprisoned at Auschwitz at  age 18.

These experiences imbued both women with a commitment to  speak out against racism and hatred and inspired them to become  social activists. McGrath will speak at UC Santa Cruz on Tuesday,  October 24, and Firestone on Tuesday, October 31. Both lectures will  start at 8 p.m. in Porter College Dining Hall.

The lectures are free and open to the public. They are  cosponsored by Porter College and the Chancellor's Distinguished  Seminar Series on Mission, Quality, and Diversity.

McGrath was 24 years old when she became involved in the  "Sleepy Lagoon" trial in Los Angeles. Twenty-two young Mexican  American men were charged with conspiracy to commit murder after  a young man was found dead at a party they had crashed near Sleepy  Lagoon. "It was one of the most racist trials in the history of  jurisprudence," McGrath told Studs Terkel in his book, A Coming of  Age. The defendants were labeled "zoot suiters" because of their  style of dress.

After twelve of the defendants were found guilty of murder  and sent to San Quentin, McGrath became executive secretary of  their defense committee. The convictions were overturned on appeal  in 1944.

McGrath went on to be an activist in a variety of ways,  including speaking at colleges and schools about the case. In 1984,  she started leading tour groups to Nicaragua to show people life  under the Sandinista government. McGrath made her 71st trip to the  country last month, bringing donated pharmaceuticals to several  hospitals.

In her lecture, McGrath will discuss the Sleepy Lagoon trial  and the social, political, and journalistic climate in which it took  place. She hopes to encourage her audience to become active in their  communities.

"We need to have an activist society--activism interpreted not  as people devoting their lives to issues, but devoting some part of  their lives," McGrath said. "Without neglecting lives, families, and  jobs, there should be some space left for people to be involved in  their community's and country's life."

Renee Firestone, who was born in Czechoslovakia, has been a  tireless advocate on the topics of holocaust education and world  hunger. Best known for her work with the Simon Wiesenthal Center  Educational Outreach Program, where she has volunteered for almost  two decades, she has spoken to schools, community groups, and other  organizations, and done interviews for television, the print media,  and radio.

At UCSC, Firestone will tell her personal story of the  holocaust to remind the audience of what can happen if people  continue to harbor racism, hatred, and violence, she said. "I try to  connect the past with what is happening today--ethnic cleansing in  Yugoslavia; genocide in Cambodia, South America, Africa," she  explained. "The lessons should have been long learned, and these  things should have never occurred if we learned the proper lessons  of the holocaust."

Firestone, her fourteen-year-old sister, and parents were  imprisoned at Auschwitz after the Germans invaded Hungary. Her  sister and mother were murdered, and her father died from  tuberculosis soon after liberation. Firestone spent thirteen months  in the camp.

After emigrating to the United States with her husband and  infant daughter in 1948 and rebuilding her life, Firestone began to  speak about the holocaust. In 1991, she started to work for the  Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, interviewing other  holocaust survivors. Founded by the producer Steven Spielberg, the  foundation aims to record the stories of tens of thousands of  holocaust survivors.

In addition to her 8 p.m. lecture, Firestone will join UCSC  alumna Susan Hersh to discuss the Spielberg project. The talk will  take place at 4:30 p.m. on October 31 at the Porter Provost's House.

The Chancellor's Distinguished Seminar Series was established  in the fall of 1993 by Chancellor Karl S. Pister and the Academic  Senate. The seminars are the public part of a program in which  prominent women and minorities spend a day with faculty and  students to discuss how to improve the quality of higher education  in the United States.
