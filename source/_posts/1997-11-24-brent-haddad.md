![Brent Haddad][2]

**Brent Haddad:** Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies

As an environmental policy expert, Brent Haddad investigates the use of market-based methods to manage natural resources. Such strategies, used, for example, to manage air and water pollution, involve the issuance of property rights that allow companies and individuals to trade their shares. Haddad's work focuses on the impact of such market mechanisms, which have a mixed track record so far. Haddad earned his B.A. and an M.A. in international relations; he has an M.B.A. from UC Berkeley, where he also earned his Ph.D. in energy and resources in 1996.
