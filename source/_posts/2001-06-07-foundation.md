## UC Santa Cruz Foundation Elects David Regan As New President

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The UC Santa Cruz Foundation has elected David B. Regan of Santa Cruz as president of the board. His two-year term took effect at the board's meeting on June 1.

The publisher of the _Santa Cruz Sentinel_ newspaper, Regan has lived in Santa Cruz since 1983. In addition to his work as a foundation trustee, Regan has served numerous community organizations in a leadership capacity. He is a past president of the Santa Cruz County Business Council, the United Way of Santa Cruz County, the Santa Cruz Unit of the American Cancer Society, and the Santa Cruz Host Lions. He also serves as a board member of the Dominican Hospital Foundation; the Delta School, a charter school that began on the UCSC campus; and the Bay Shore Lyric Opera in Capitola.

On the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, Regan helped establish the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards Program that provides $20,000 scholarships to selected community college students who continue their education at UCSC; he was also a leader in the foundation project to build the Seymour Marine Discovery Center at Long Marine Laboratory and the Center for Ocean Health.

"UC Santa Cruz is an exceptional university that is making significant contributions worldwide," Regan said. "I'm am very eager to serve the university in this new capacity and look forward to a very productive term as president."

Kenneth A. Feingold, a Los Angeles attorney, was named vice president. Feingold is the first UCSC graduate (Cowell College '71, B.A. history) to serve as an officer of the foundation.

"I am delighted that these two individuals have assumed leadership roles on our foundation," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "The work that the foundation does in support of UCSC is directly linked to the excellence of UCSC's teaching, research, and public service activities."

Ronald Suduiko, vice chancellor for University Relations at UCSC, said that Regan and Feingold have the vision and experience needed for the foundation's two top leadership posts. He also praised outgoing president Paul Irwin, a retired business executive and resident of Watsonville. "Paul was a tireless servant of UCSC even before he became president. But his work as president has permanently strengthened the foundation--and ultimately, strengthened the campus itself."

The UC Santa Cruz Foundation promotes and supports academic programs, scholarships and fellowships, and capital improvements at UCSC through its private fundraising efforts.
