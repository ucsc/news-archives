SANTA CRUZ, CA--In Santa Cruz County, outreach workers with the  Santa Cruz AIDS Project and Santa Cruz Needle Exchange have been  hitting the streets to offer injection drug users spot counseling,  safe-sex information, condoms, clean needles, and referrals to  treatment programs. Injection drug users are a critical group to  reach in the battle against AIDS because they, their sexual partners,  and their children make up the fastest-growing group of new cases  of HIV infection.

But no one knows just how effective these local outreach  efforts have been. A new two-year study aims to evaluate the  effectiveness of such work and will pave the way for the  development of a model outreach program for small cities and other  nonmetropolitan areas.

Craig Reinarman, an associate professor of sociology at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, in collaboration with Sharon  Green, director of education and prevention at the Santa Cruz AIDS  Project (SCAP), has received a grant of $178,606 from UC's  Universitywide AIDS Research Program to conduct the study.  Reinarman and Green will work to expand existing outreach efforts  and to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of what has been  developed in Santa Cruz. "There is initial evidence of the need for  these programs and the effectiveness of these programs," says  Reinarman. "But they need to be evaluated so we can fine-tune them  and demonstrate their effectiveness."

"It is crucial to reach injection drug users, but they are  particularly difficult to contact," adds Reinarman. Due to limited  funding and staff resources, SCAP and Santa Cruz Needle Exchange  have lacked the capacity to evaluate the impact of their work, says  Reinarman.

During the study, titled "Preventing HIV in Injection Drug  Users: A Small City Model," more than 500 injection drug users will  be interviewed, and a written questionnaire will be administered by  trained volunteers and paid staff from SCAP and Santa Cruz Needle  Exchange. Reinarman will develop the questionnaire, monitor data  collection, analyze the results, and ultimately create the model for  replication elsewhere. In addition, a consortium of local AIDS  service providers and representatives from health and social service  agencies will meet every two months to compare notes on the use of  AIDS-related services and to discuss strategies for controlling the  spread of HIV. "We're building a cross-agency infrastructure so that  Santa Cruz County will be better able to respond to the AIDS crisis,"  says Reinarman.

"We need to find out what services work best for which  subgroups within the injection drug-using population," says  Reinarman, noting that Santa Cruz Needle Exchange has developed an  innovative home visitation program designed to reach women  injection drug users because they are less likely than men to go out  to needle exchange sites or outreach centers.

Although many major metropolitan areas have sophisticated  outreach programs targeting intravenous drug users, smaller cities  often lack the expertise or resources to launch such efforts, says  Reinarman. "For every San Francisco and New York, there are 100  small cities like Santa Cruz that certainly have injection drug users  but don't have any services for them," he says. "Our systematic  evaluation of a fairly advanced outreach program here in Santa Cruz  will help us develop a model for use in other cities. We'll know what  works and why."

Most injection drug users in Santa Cruz County use heroin,  although there is cocaine and amphetamine use, as well, says  Reinarman.

The Universitywide AIDS Research Program, which funded the  study, was established in 1983 to link the scientific expertise of UC  faculty with community organizations in AIDS-related research  projects. The state legislature allocates funds for the program each  year; this study is one of five that were funded statewide this year.
