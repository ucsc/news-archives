**June Gordon:** Assistant Professor of Education

If June Gordon looks familiar, it's probably because she arrived at UCSC two years ago as a visiting professor and has since been hired as an assistant professor. Gordon's research focuses on how culture and socioeconomic class impact the perception of education and teaching nationally and internationally. She is currently conducting research in urban schools in Japan, England, and the United States. Gordon earned her Ph.D. in educational leadership and policy studies at the University of Washington. She earned her M.S. in adult education at Western Washington University and her B.A. in East Asian studies at Stanford University.
