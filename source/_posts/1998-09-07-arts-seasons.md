UCSC's Arts & Lectures, the largest presenting organization in the Monterey Bay Area, has just announced its 1998-99 season. Running from October 9 to April 20, the series will include 17 performances by 14 nationally and internationally known artists, continuing a tradition of presenting high-caliber performances and educational opportunities in the arts.

Highlights of this year's diverse season include an evening with legendary jazzman Wynton Marsalis conducting the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, the newest work of the internationally acclaimed Paul Taylor Dance Company, a 25th anniversary celebration by Kronos Quartet, the sardonic humor of National Public Radio commentator David Sedaris, a wacky Millennium Musical by the Reduced Shakespeare Company, a reading by revered poet Adrienne Rich from her new book, _Midnight Salvage,_ and much more. Season brochures are available by calling (831) 459-2159.

Along with presenting some of the world's leading performers and most exciting emerging artists, Arts & Lectures' upcoming season also provides opportunities for audience members and area students to interact with performers through residencies, lectures, workshops, and master classes. Additionally, many artists will be available for pre- or postperformance discussion, and authors will be available for book signings. The 1998-99 Arts & Lectures' season is cosponsored by KUSP 88.9 FM and _Metro Santa Cruz_.
