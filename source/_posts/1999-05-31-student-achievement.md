title: UCSC Undergrads Honored In Week Of Events And Ceremonies

Hundreds of UCSC students are being honored for their outstanding work in research and academic achievement during the campus's Student Achievement Week, which takes place June 1-4.

Many of the honorees are students who have received awards recognizing their achievement in research and other scholarly activities. Many will present their work publicly through a myriad of events--everything from art exhibitions and theater performances to a natural sciences and engineering poster symposium. The weeklong celebration culminates in an awards ceremony on Friday June 4, from 2 to 4 p.m. at the University House.

"UCSC is known for having a faculty committed to working very closely with undergraduates and in fostering discovery in and outside of the classroom," said Lynda Goff, associate vice chancellor for undergraduate education at UCSC and a professor of biology.

"As a major research university, we are able to offer our students the resources and experiences that enable them to integrate research, service, and learning. Our strong commitment to, and emphasis of, research as an integral part of the undergraduate experience is likely one of the most important factors leading to the high rate of our UCSC undergraduates going on to receive doctorates," she said. "Recent data shows that we rank number two of all U.S. public universities in this respect. It's a winning combination and I think the evidence of its success can be seen throughout the week through the many events taking place on campus that demonstrate the exceptional work of our students."

The following is a list of events taking place during Student Achievement Week. Most events are free, and all are open to the public. For more information, call the number provided below each listing.
