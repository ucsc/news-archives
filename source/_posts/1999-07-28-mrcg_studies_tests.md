## M.R.C. Greenwood Speaks At Special Symposium On National Study Of Standardized Testing For College Admissions

University of California, Santa Cruz Chancellor , served as co-chair for National Research Council committee issuing report that has assessed use-and potential misuse-of the SAT and ACT tests.

WHAT: The National Research Council (NRC) will hold a colloquium to discuss a new study focused on whether or not standardized tests have a place in the undergraduate admissions processes for U.S. colleges and universities. The report looks at myths of standardized testing; presents the steering committee's assessment of the role of tests; identifies ways to use test scores in a technically sound manner; and considers if there are alternatives to standardized tests, among other topics. A featured speaker at the colloquium is M.R.C. Greenwood, chancellor of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and chair of NRC's Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel (OSEP). She is co-chair of the NRC steering committee issuing the report. Her co-chair, also a speaker at the colloquium, is Robert Linn, education professor at the University of Colorado and chair of NRC's Board on Testing and Assessment (BOTA). Other speakers, who also have served on the steering committee, are Christopher Edley Jr., law professor at Harvard University; and John D. Wiley, provost at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

WHEN: The colloquium is Thursday, July 29, noon to 1:30 p.m. (EDT). The report will be available on July 28. To receive a copy of the report, contact the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Office of News and Public Information, 202.334.2138. California reporters also may contact the UC Santa Cruz Public Affairs Office, 831.459.2495.

WHERE: The colloquium will be held at the Cecil and Ida Green Building, Room 104, 2001 Wisconsin Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Reporters who wish to attend should register in advance with the National Academy of Sciences' Office of News and Public Information, 202.334.2138.

BACKGROUND: On Wednesday, July 28, the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences will release a study that examines the use of the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the American College Test (ACT) in U.S. undergraduate college admissions processes. Two units of the National Research Council-the Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel (OSEP) and the Board on Testing and Assessment (BOTA)-have collaborated on an investigation of the issues of standardized testing, including consideration of fairness and effectiveness in identifying individuals who are college-ready. The results of a scholarly workshop and more than six-months of analysis have been distilled into this study. The study urges caution in several key areas, and notes, among other considerations, potential disparate impact of test results for minority populations.
