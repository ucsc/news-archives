SANTA CRUZ, CA--Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood of the University of  California, Santa Cruz, has announced a five-part initiative that  characterizes UCSC's approach to ensuring continued quality and  diversity among the campus's student body. The new program,  "Partnership to Ensure Access and Quality," has two intertwined  objectives: (1) to participate in the improvement of preparation for  university eligibility; and (2) the active development of more  scholarship funds to ensure access to UCSC for qualified students  regardless of their economic backgrounds.

In making the announcement, Chancellor Greenwood stated, "I  call upon the entire UCSC community to join me in ensuring the  continued open access and academic excellence which characterize  UCSC today. In the confusing aftermath surrounding Proposition 209,  it is more important than ever that UC Santa Cruz communicates-- and demonstrates--that we are accessible to all qualified students,  and that we accept responsibility to join with our partners in all  segments of education to prepare today's students for tomorrow's  challenges."

Specific elements of this initiative include plans to:

* Commit a $1 million endowment to help ensure in perpetuity  the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Program. (The Leadership  Opportunity Program provides a two-year [$10,000 per year]  scholarship for each recipient. The scholarships are awarded to  students transferring from each of the region's thirteen community  colleges.)
* Focus on scholarship fundraising. (This includes a  commitment of the UCSC Alumni Association to build its scholarship  endowment from $200,000 to $1 million, as well as a plan to hire a  development officer to generate more scholarship funds for  campuswide use.)
* Enhance existing coordination and increase campus  involvement with K-12 educational issues and opportunities. (The  Chancellor's Educational Outreach Council, a newly appointed group  chaired by UCSC's social sciences dean Martin Chemers, will  recommend approaches for expanding UCSC's partnerships with K-12  schools and community colleges.)
* Expand the successful "Take UCSC Home" program. (Begun  last spring, this program encourages current students to visit their  high schools as ambassadors of UCSC, giving them a chance to  develop professional skills while sharing information about the  campus's programs and services from the student perspective.)
* Increase partnerships with schools and community colleges  throughout California, and increase communications with  prospective students, their parents, and counselors. (Utilizing the  existing online application system, "Pathways," and expanding  UCSC's innovative Success Team approach, UC Santa Cruz will ease  student application and admission processes and will help students  in their transition to UCSC. Currently, UCSC has direct online  connections with 40 high schools and community colleges in the  region and throughout California, more than any other UC campus,  and this new focus will double that number within the next year. In  addition, UCSC is helping build and maintain access to the  information superhighway for regional schools. This is being  accomplished through an innovative partnership between UCSC's  Communications and Technology Services and the Santa Cruz and  Monterey County offices of education.

Chancellor Greenwood's statement emphasized that these  initiatives represent the further development of ongoing efforts.  "Drawing qualified students, including women and minorities, to  UCSC is not about righting past wrongs. Rather, it is all about  developing the talent we will need as a society to thrive in the next  century."
