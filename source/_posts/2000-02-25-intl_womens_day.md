## Performances March 7-8 Commemorate International Women's Day

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The experiences of women during war are highlighted during "Women in Black," a highly acclaimed multifaceted performance that features dance, live music, oral history, and projected visual images. To commemorate International Women's Day, the compelling show is coming to Santa Cruz for two performances on March 7-8.

The show captures the adversity, pain, and injustices committed against women during war and was inspired by the Women in Black antiwar movement. Women dressed in black in more than 25 countries around the world gather to stand in silent vigil every week to protest war and the disappearance of their loved ones.

"Women in Black" is a powerful performance celebrating the collective spirit of women that rises to meet the challenges of war. Directed and choreographed by Thais Mazur, the performance includes dancers from the Thais Mazur Dance Company and original live music.

The first performance will take place on Tuesday, March 7, at 7 p.m. in Kresge Town Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus. The second performance is scheduled for Wednesday, March 8, at 7 p.m. in the Louden Nelson Community Center Auditorium at 301 Center Street in Santa Cruz. Admission to both performances is free

In addition, three black dresses worn by women protesting violence will be on display at the performance venues. The dresses are being sent around the world to call attention to the Women in Black Against War movement. The owners' names and countries are sewn into the garments.

Both performances are being sponsored by the UCSC Women's Center and the Women's Studies Department, Beyond Beijing, the United Nations Association, and Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. For more information, call Helen Mayer at the UCSC Women's Center at (831) 459- 2291 or Erin Ramsden at (831) 502-9925.
