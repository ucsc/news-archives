SANTA CRUZ, CA--Shoppers will see more variety and more plants  than ever at the annual Spring Plant Sale at the University of  California, Santa Cruz. The sale takes place May 6 and 7 from 10 a.m.  to 2 p.m.

More than 7,000 organically produced plants will be offered  for sale this year, representing 200 different species, said Orin  Martin, manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden at UCSC. Last year,  roughly 5,000 plants of 100 different varieties were offered for  sale. The species chosen for the sale are hardy plants, requiring only  moderate maintenance. "They aren't fussy," said Martin.

The sale features numerous varieties of vegetables, perennial  flowers, everlastings, and native plants and shrubs. Prices are  generally lower than those at nurseries, ranging from $1.50 for a  vegetable six-pack to $5 for a one-gallon delphinium or lavender.

This year's selection includes the following:

\-- Vegetable starts, including salad mix, leaf crops, tomatoes,  peppers, basil, and potatoes.

\-- Cottage-garden perennial flowers, including delphinium,  columbine, and wallflowers.

\-- Everlasting perennials, including a number of species of  statice and yarrow.

\-- Perennial herbs, including tarragon, rosemary, lavender,  oregano, and marjoram.

\-- California and Mediterranean natives, including santolinas  and sages.

The sale will take place at UCSC's Barn Theater parking lot at  the corner of Bay and High streets at the base of the UCSC campus.  The sale is sponsored by the Friends of the Farm and Garden, a  community-based group that provides financial support to the UCSC  Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems and helps  educate the public about the importance of sustainable agriculture.  Proceeds from the sale support the center's apprenticeship program,  a six-month course in organic farming and gardening at the Farm and  Garden.

For more information about the Spring Plant Sale or the  Friends of the Farm and Garden, call the Center for Agroecology at  (408) 459-4140.
