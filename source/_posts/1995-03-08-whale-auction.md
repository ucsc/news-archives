SANTA CRUZ, CA--Visitors to Long Marine Lab love its blue-whale  skeleton. But there's another whale that really helps the lab thrive:  the "Whale of an Auction," an annual fund-raising event for the lab's  public education programs.

This year's extravaganza, the tenth annual auction, begins at 6  p.m. on Friday, March 31, in the Porter College Dining Hall at UC  Santa Cruz. About 400 people traditionally attend the auction, which  raises tens of thousands of dollars for the lab's burgeoning outreach  efforts.

An evening at the auction includes a stand-up buffet,  champagne and caviar, and both silent and live auctions. The  Redwood String Quartet will provide live music.

Items up for bid will include Hawaiian getaways, Mexican  cruises, fly-fishing in Colorado, and other vacations; behind-the- scenes tours, including one with a whale kiss; tickets to sports  events; meals at fine restaurants; pottery and other artworks; and  jewelry, wines, and scores of other gifts. The Slawinski Auction  Company will oversee the festivities.

Proceeds help thousands of schoolchildren and visitors to Long  Marine Lab learn about the Monterey Bay marine environment and  marine research at UCSC through the "Window to Discovery" and  other programs. The Friends of Long Marine Lab, sponsors of the  auction, also are raising funds for a new Visitor Education Center at  the lab.

Tickets are $30 in advance or $35 at the door. For  reservations, call Long Marine Lab at 459-2883.

Donations to the auction or to the lab's education programs are  welcome. For more information, call Lisa M. Rose at 459-3694.
