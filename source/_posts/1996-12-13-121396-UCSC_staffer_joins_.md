title: UCSC Anthro Lab Manager Joins Human-rights Mission To Croatia

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The horrors of war became much more vivid for Josh  Snodgrass recently when he spent three weeks on a humanitarian mission in  Croatia, examining the remains of bodies recovered from a mass grave.

Trained in forensic anthropology, Snodgrass took a leave from his job  managing the anthropology labs at UC Santa Cruz to participate in the  evidence-gathering mission, which was sponsored by Physicians for Human  Rights under a United Nations contract.

In a grim re-creation of scenes from war-torn regions such as  Guatemala, El Salvador, and Rwanda, pathologists, autopsy technicians,  photographers, evidence technicians, and anthropologists joined forces to  gather evidence of war crimes for prosecutors.

Three people have been indicted for the killings of 200 people at the  gravesite near the city of Vukovar, though none is in custody. Physical  evidence gathered by the team will bolster the case, which first came to  light when a survivor told the story of his escape and led investigators to  the site.

The tragedy began in July 1991, when Vukovar, a city of 85,000 people,  came under heavy fire from Serbian forces. After four months of shelling,  the city was destroyed and most residents had fled. Several hundred people  remained in the hospital, huddled in the basement after the upper floors had  been destroyed. Without food, water, or supplies, the doctors were  transfusing their own blood to help patients. By mid-November,  arrangements were made by the International Red Cross--with the  permission of the Serbs--to evacuate the hospital.

"Even as Serb forces were meeting with hospital staff outside the  building, other Serbs went through the back way and cleared the building,  loading more than 200 people--all men between the ages of 16 and 60--onto  buses," says Snodgrass. The men were taken to an empty warehouse and  beaten for four hours. Two died and seven others were released for  unexplained reasons, according to witness testimony. As the remaining  victims were being transported by truck to a farm in the nearby town of  Ovcara, one man jumped to freedom. It is his story that led investigators six  months later to discover the mass grave where the others perished.

The preliminary investigation of the site didn't begin until the end of  1992\. Early findings seemed to confirm the man's story, but local Serb  authorities then barred access to the site until this past August. Two  months of excavation produced 200 bodies.

The United Nations took over the still-unfinished Zagreb Medical  School for the next phase of the investigation. Snodgrass worked with about  a dozen colleagues from around the world to conduct laboratory analyses  that included X-rays and autopsies. Some members of the team stayed on for  three or four months; others, like Snodgrass, rotated through in two- and  three-week cycles.

Snodgrass, who arrived October 6 and spent three weeks in Zagreb,  examined bones to build a "biological profile" of each individual, compiling  details of stature, age, sex, ancestry, and evidence of trauma, such as healed  fractures from childhood, bullet wounds, and marks from the butt of a rifle.

Snodgrass, who graduated from UCSC in anthropology in 1995, had  examined the remains of about 20 people in his work with Alison Galloway,  an associate professor of anthropology. But nothing had prepared him for the  scale of this task.

"Even for people with a lot of experience, it's still very difficult to  switch over to conditions like that," says Snodgrass. "We worked long days,  seven days a week, and most of the time we tried to stay detached. You  pretty much had to be detached to keep yourself sane, but there certainly  were times when you couldn't help but be moved by how massive it was. It's  very different than what we see here, thank God."

It was particularly difficult to view video footage shot by Independent  Television News at the hospital the day before the evacuation, says  Snodgrass. "We saw the patients and really got an idea of who these people  were," he recalls. "That was hard."

The facility lacked such basics as running water and heat, but  Snodgrass was invigorated by the opportunity to work with Clyde Snow, the  "grandfather of forensic anthropology." "I really learned a lot about looking  at trauma," says Snodgrass, adding that most of the victims died of gunshots  to the head. "Even though it was just three weeks, it seemed like years. Once  they assessed my skills, I was given a lot of freedom."

The team's forensic analysis was finished in late November and the  findings were forwarded to prosecutors in the Netherlands, says Snodgrass,  who plans to follow the Vukovar case through contact with members of the  International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
