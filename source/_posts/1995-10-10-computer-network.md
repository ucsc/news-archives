title: "UC Santa Cruz Hooks Up To New Wireless Computer Network: Students To Surf The Internet From The Great Meadow, Under The Redwoods"

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Thao Vo found new freedom last year in a little  black box the size of a television remote control.

A senior at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Vo used  this little box and his laptop computer to hook up to the Internet  from a bench outside the Science Library, from atop a rock at the  Upper Quarry, and from his room in a campus residence hall.

"The same things I would go to the computer lab for, the  modem could do," said Vo, who helped test a new wireless computer  network for UCSC. "I put the computer in my backpack a lot-- I felt really free."

Using a wireless modem, students--and later this year, faculty  and staff--can zap signals from laptop computers to the campus  computer network, enabling them to send and receive electronic  mail, research a topic at McHenry Library, and explore the World  Wide Web from anywhere in Santa Cruz.

The modems also offer faster Internet connection than  conventional modems--and free up telephone lines. These advantages  even make them desirable for those who use deskbound computers.

"UC Santa Cruz is at the leading edge in testing and using this  new wireless technology," said Fred Siff, associate vice chancellor  for Communications and Technology Services. "The technology should  save the campus millions of dollars by eliminating the need to wire  the residence halls for direct Internet access."

Perhaps more importantly, it will better suit students'  lifestyles than traditional computing, he added. "Using a computer  should be fun," Siff said. "You should not have to go into a dark  basement and sit next to a wall in order to do computing."

The campus completed a nine-month test of the wireless  system, known as "Ricochet," in June. Ricochet was developed by  Metricom, Inc., a ten-year-old company based in Los Gatos. In what  Siff describes as a partnership between UCSC and Metricom, the  Silicon Valley company installed the network at its own cost,  anticipating UCSC and the campus community would pay for modems  and the service.

The wireless modem uses radio waves to connect users'  computers with an Internet service provider: in this case, UCSC's  computer network, which is accessible to students, faculty, and  staff. Sent by the modem, radio signals pass to radio repeaters  mounted on top of campus buildings. The signals then "hop" between  repeaters before entering a wired access point where they are  carried via UCSC's high-speed data transmission lines to the  Internet. More than 50 transmitters perch on UCSC's rooftops, each  the size of a shoe box.

The technology should allow UCSC to avoid wiring its more  than 50 residence halls with data transmission lines, a project that  is estimated would cost more than $4 million, said Elise Levinson,  an assistant director at Housing Services. Such costs are usually  passed to students through higher room-and-board rates. By offering  the wireless service, UCSC is asking only those students who use  the technology to pay for it.

To launch the program this fall, Housing Services purchased  150 wireless modems and made them available to students living on  campus. The students agreed to pay $19.95 a month to Metricom for  the use of the wireless service. Other on-campus students and those  living off campus may purchase modems for $199, plus pay for the  service. Faculty and staff will be able to buy modems and tap into  the service by the beginning of the new year, Siff said.

Those at UCSC who don't want to purchase the Metricom  modems or pay for the service may either dial into the campus  network from home over relatively lower-speed telephone lines, or  go to one of the ten campus computer labs for a direct--and much  faster--Internet connection.

These alternatives have been available for several years, but  are in high demand, Siff said. With 65 percent of incoming freshmen  owning personal computers, the labs and 130 telephone lines for  Internet access are usually swamped. Offering students wireless  modems is seen as a way to ease the pressure on labs and telephone  lines.

Erin Thomas was one of fifteen students from Crown and  Merrill colleges who helped test the wireless system starting last  November. She found the wireless modem and portable computer she  borrowed to be invaluable.

A computer and information sciences student, Thomas used the  modem roughly twelve hours each week to communicate with  classmates, teachers, and teaching assistants, and to do her  programming homework, she said. Thomas believes if she hadn't had  the wireless modem, she would have needed to get an additional  phone line. And she wouldn't have completed her work as easily.

"My classmates had wire modems and had all sorts of  problems," Thomas said. "I was always able to get on-line."

During the system pilot, roughly 30 rooftop transmitters  carried the modem signal over a triangular area encompassing Crown  and Merrill colleges, McHenry Library, and the Communications  Building, Siff said. Since then, Metricom has installed additional  transmitters on campus and on Santa Cruz streetlights, extending  coverage throughout the campus and city.

The company plans to set up transmitters in Monterey and in  every major city--and most small cities--in the San Francisco Bay  Area, from as far north as Walnut Creek to as far south as Gilroy.  Networks at nine other campuses--including UC Berkeley, Stanford  University, and California Polytechnic State University-San Luis  Obispo--are expected to be complete by the end of the year. Next  year, Metricom plans to extend service to five additional college  campuses.
