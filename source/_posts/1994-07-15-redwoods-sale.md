SAN FRANCISCO--The University of California Board of Regents  today (Friday, July 15) approved the sale for $2.4 million of a 410- acre redwood parcel to Save-the Redwoods League. The sale of the  parcel, which contains some old-growth redwoods, ensures that the  property will be available for public use.

The land, called the "Miller property," is located on Kings Creek  Road, three miles north of Boulder Creek in Santa Cruz County. Most  of the proceeds from the sale will go to the UC Santa Cruz campus to  establish an endowment fund for financial aid.

Proceeds from the sale will be allocated as follows:

* $2.1 million will go to UCSC to fund undergraduate  scholarships and graduate fellowships.

* A total of $300,000 will be used to establish or enhance  scholarships at UC Berkeley and UCSC in the names of Horace Marden  Albright, who was a leading conservationist and former director of  the National Park Service, and to establish two undergraduate  scholarships for students of environmental studies at UCSC in the  names of Robert Gordon Sproul, former president of the university,  and Newton B. Drury, former director of the National Park Service  and former secretary of the Save-the-Redwoods League.

UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister expressed satisfaction with the  outcome of the negotiations. "This sale will preserve the site for the  public, and the proceeds will help preserve access to the university  by enriching our financial aid endowment," said Pister. "This is the  type of outcome the campus had sought from the beginning."

In May, the university took the unusual step of rejecting all  bids for the property in order to pursue discussions with potential  buyers who were interested in preserving the property as open  space. Announcement of the final sale marks the end of a process  that began in February 1993 after  the UCSC campus determined that the property was surplus and  requested that it be sold.

Peltason rejected the bids in May, saying that he felt doing so  was in the best interests of the university and the state of  California. The three bidders were: Eel River Saw Mills, Inc., at  $2,380,000; Roger Burch, a Santa Cruz saw mill owner at  $2,332,000; and the Save-the-Redwoods League at $2,100,000. The  university had a legal obligation to sell the property to the highest  bidder or reject all bids.

About half of the property was deeded to the University of  California by Adolph C. Miller and  Mary Sprague Miller in 1942, with the remainder purchased by the  university in 1952. It has been held for campus use and contains some groves of old-growth  redwoods on approximately 38 acres. The balance of the property  consists of second-growth redwood, Douglas fir, hardwoods,  meadows, and grasslands. A creek runs through the property year- round.

The university operated a campground on the property from  1967 through 1974. The campground, which operated at a deficit to  UCSC, was closed following extensive storm damage.

In 1991 and 1992, the UCSC campus evaluated all potential  uses of the site for academic or administrative purposes and  determined that there were no feasible campus uses. Maintenance  costs and liability concerns were an insupportable burden on the  campus, and the property was subsequently declared surplus. In  February 1993, the campus requested that the property be sold.

Because of the attributes of the property and the strong local  interest in preserving the land in its present form, the university  focused its first sale efforts on identifying a buyer who would  preserve the property for public use.

Before soliciting private bids, the university and the UCSC  campus from March through May of 1993 invited eighteen government  and nonprofit entities, and representatives of such entities, to  purchase the property for public use.

Despite the university's efforts, all prebid sale discussions  ended without offers by the fall of 1993, except discussions with  Santa Cruz County. Those discussions were extended until December  1993, when the county indicated that it could not acquire the  property. Competitive sealed-bid documents were subsequently  prepared, and the property was offered for a minimum bid of $2  million beginning in March 1994.

In offering the property by competitive bid, the university  retained a conservation easement on seventeen acres to preserve in  its entirety the most significant and accessible grove of old-growth  trees on the property. In addition, state regulations and other  factors would have limited the harvest of the old-growth trees  outside of the easement area.
