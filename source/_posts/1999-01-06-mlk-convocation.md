**Noted Author, Commentator, And Professor Michael Eric Dyson Will Deliver The Keynote Speech On January 28**

SANTA CRUZ, CA-Michael Eric Dyson has been called a "hip-hop intellectual" and a "street fighter in a suit and tie." Also a noted author, commentator, professor, and ordained Baptist minister, Dyson will be the featured speaker at the 15th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation later this month.

The title for Dyson's keynote speech is "Bridging the Generation Gap: Creating Conversation for Civil Rights." The convocation will take place at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, 307 Church Street, Santa Cruz, on Thursday, January 28. It begins at 7 p.m. and is free and open to the public. No tickets are required.

The annual convocation, sponsored by the University of California, Santa Cruz, celebrates the life and the vision of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. with music, welcoming speeches, and a keynote address by a prominent figure. The convocation is intended to build partnerships, create connections, and develop dialogue within the on-campus and off-campus communities.

Described as "one of the youngest stars in the firmament of black intellectuals" by the Chronicle of Higher Education, Dyson, 39, is known for his commitment to urban youth and passion for popular culture. His lectures and writings draw from sources ranging from the French philosopher Michel Foucault to the American rap musician Snoop Doggy Dog.

Dyson's own history is equally broad. He is currently a Visiting Distinguished Professor of African-American Studies at Columbia University, but his resume includes work as a janitor, factory laborer, and construction worker. It also encompasses time spent on welfare after a layoff from a clerking position, a Ph.D. degree in religion from Princeton, a pastorship at a Detroit Baptist church, numerous speaking engagements, and a number of published articles and books.

Dyson's books include Between God and Gangsta Rap: Bearing Witness to Black Culture; Making Malcom: The Myth and Meaning of Malcom X; and Race Rules: Navigating the Color Line. His latest book, to be published this year, is titled "What Have We Come To: Bridging the Generation Gap." His articles have appeared in such publications as the New York Times, Vibe magazine, and Rolling Stone.

At the January 28 convocation, other speakers will include UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, who will deliver the welcoming address, and UCSC sociology professor John Brown Childs, who will introduce Dyson. The convocation will also include poetry, music, and additional speakers from the campus and community.
