title: Campus Volunteers Needed For Job-Shadow Program

The Chancellor's Office is seeking UCSC faculty, staff, and administrators to act as mentors for North Monterey County High School's Job Shadow Program. Approximately 45 volunteers are needed for this year's program, which will take place on Thursday, April 16, from 9:30 a.m. to noon.

During that time, 45 North Monterey sophomores will shadow UCSC employees through an orientation meeting and a morning on the job. The experience is designed to encourage young adults to think and ask questions about career and educational goals. In addition to answering questions about their work, UCSC mentors will be asked to critique their protege's resume and describe their own career and educational paths.

At noon, mentors are invited to share lunch with their "shadow" if they choose. Students then tour the campus from 12:45 to 1:30 p.m. before leaving for Monterey.

"Both the mentors and especially the student 'shadows' get a lot out of the small amount of time they get to share together," said chancellor's undergraduate intern Vinay Patel, who is coordinating the event this year.

"The students get to see firsthand a person who has worked hard to reach a certain position in their career, and for some who are not able to visualize what a career process is like, it can be a very impressionable day," he added.

Employees who wish to participate must receive prior approval from their supervisors and express their interest as soon as possible, but before April 10. For more information, call Patel at (408) 502-7912.
