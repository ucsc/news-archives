![\[Photo of site where building is beginning on the University Town Center\]][1] City officials, the developer, and UCSC administrators gathered on June 23 to celebrate the start of construction on a new building in downtown Santa Cruz. Dubbed "University Town Center," the building will house University Extension and approximately 100 UCSC and extension students. It will rise at the pictured site, the corner of Pacific Avenue and Cathcart Street and the former location of Ford's Department Store. Ford's was severely damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and was subsequently torn down. The five-story building is expected to be completed by fall 1999. It will feature University Extension offices, a computer lab, and classrooms on a portion of the second floor and apartments for extension foreign students and regularly enrolled UCSC students on the top two floors.
