**Ellen Moir,** director of the New Teacher Center that opened downtown officially last month, did a round of interviews associated with the opening. Stories appeared on KSBW-TV, Bay TV in San Francisco, KION-TV, as well as KCBS and KLIV Radio. Other reporters covering the event came from the Associated Press, the _San Jose Mercury News,_ and the _San Francisco Chronicle._

Long Marine Lab's resident sea lions, **Rocky** and **Rio,** were featured in a PBS TV show called _Animal Einsteins,_ which aired in January on KQED. That led to a story in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ about the brainy pinnipeds and the researchers studying them, biologist **Ronald Schusterman** and graduate student **Colleen Reichmuth.**

**Carrol Moran** and public information director **Elizabeth Irwin** were on KSCO last month talking with Ted Jefferson about the campus and university's new Educational Partnership Center, which Moran directs.

An article in the _Sacramento Bee_ about seaborne illnesses that threaten people and marine life featured the comments of professor of ocean sciences **Mary Silver.** Silver is studying marine algae that produce the toxin domoic acid. Blooms of these toxic algae have been implicated in recent poisonings of sea lions and fish-eating birds on the central California coast.

The **Lick Observatory** and UCSC astronomers were featured in several articles in the _San Jose Mercury News_ in January. The stories dealt with the search for planets around distant stars and recent discoveries about solar systems outside our own. Much of the research in this area is being done at UC's Lick Observatory and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Astrophysicist **Douglas Lin,** an expert on planet formation and the evolution of solar systems, was featured in two of the articles.
