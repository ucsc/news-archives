title: Lecture Series Continues With January 9 Talk On Human Evolution
author: Jennifer McNulty

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Adrienne Zihlman, professor of anthropology at UC Santa  Cruz, is the featured speaker in this month's Humanities Lecture Series,  presented jointly by UCSC's Humanities Division and the Museum of Art and  History. Zihlman's talk, ""Africa, Apes, and Ancestors: An Abridged Account  of Human Evolution," takes place from 7 to 8 P.M. on Thursday, January 9, at  the Museum of Art and History at the McPherson Center, 705 Front St., Santa  Cruz. The talk is free and open to the public. A reception follows.

Zihlman has spent 30 years studying primate anatomy, locomotion, and  human evolution.  Unlike some physical anthropologists, she is not content to study only the  fossil record for clues to human evolution. She believes the key to  understanding how our ape ancestors functioned lies in the muscles, flesh,  and movement of modern animals, and she is using groundbreaking data  gathered in the dissection laboratory to reevaluate the fossil record.

On the subject of human evolution, Zihlman parts company with her  colleagues who theorize that humans walk upright because our male  predecessors 3 million years ago had to free their hands to hunt animals for  food. Instead, in a hypothesis that integrates fossil evidence, molecular  discoveries, and chimpanzee behavior, Zihlman believes that female  activities, such as food-gathering and caring for infants, are just as likely  to have triggered the transition to two-legged locomotion.

It was her work on chimpanzees that prompted Zihlman and three  colleagues to propose in 1978 that pygmy chimpanzees--not common chimps  or gorillas--are the best living model of a common ancestor of African apes  and humans. Zihlman's recent pioneering work on gorilla anatomy includes  male-female comparisons that have never been done before.

Zihlman joined the UCSC faculty in 1967 and is the author of The  Human Evolution Coloring Book (New York: Barnes & Noble, 1982).
