**For release in conjunction with the session on Ocean Science and  Engineering at the 1996 meeting of the American Association for the  Advancement of Science. The session runs from 2:30 to 5:30 p.m. EST  on Friday, February 9, in room 321 of the Baltimore Convention  Center.**

BALTIMORE, MD--Monterey Bay, one of the most beautiful notches in  the California coast, is under constant surveillance. The spies are  weather sensors, marine instruments, video cameras, and other  robotic eyes set up in the bay and around its rim. The formidable  task of Patrick Mantey and his coworkers is to collect information  from that array and display it graphically for meteorologists,  oceanographers, and other interested researchers--all in real time.

That's the essence of REINAS (Real-Time Environmental  Information Network and Analysis System), a $4.7 million project  funded by the Office of Naval Research. Now in the fourth year of its  five-year grant, REINAS is beginning to fulfill its charge of bringing  environmental science into a more intimate relationship with state-of-the-art computer and network systems and visualization  technology.

Mantey, the Jack Baskin Professor of Computer Engineering at  the University of California, Santa Cruz, will describe REINAS in a  talk during a session on "Ocean Science and Engineering" at the  annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of  Science.

"Our aim is to support real-time forecasting in meteorology  and real-time applications in oceanography," Mantey says. "To do  that, we must answer this question: What is our best estimate of the  state of the environment right now? We see the potential to turn  REINAS into an operational laboratory--a real-time 3-D geographic  information system that presents data to any user over the Internet.  Not every scientist has been able to take advantage of those new  communications tools, so for many of them this is a different way  of doing things."

UC Santa Cruz is the lead institution on the project, which  involves contributions from several faculty members in computer  sciences and engineering, visiting researchers, and a cadre of  graduate students. Collaborating institutions are the Monterey Bay  Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and the Naval Postgraduate  School of Monterey, with which UCSC recently signed a formal  agreement for partnerships in research, education, and public  service.

Work to date on REINAS falls into three main categories:

* Data acquisition. The team has set up Internet links with a  dozen sites in and around the bay, ranging from ridgetops to the  coastline and to ships off shore. The stations include standard  meteorological instruments that collect data a few times each  minute on temperature, winds, humidity, barometric pressure,  precipitation, and solar radiation. A few stations have radar  systems to measure ocean currents and vertical wind profiles; ocean  sensors gauge water temperatures and wave heights. Researchers  are adding images from weather satellites to this mix.
* Data management. Developing an underlying system to cope  with continuous large streams of data, and to archive them in  readily accessible ways, has proven a vigorous hardware and  software challenge. When all data sources come on-line, the finished  network may have to handle the equivalent of 300,000 typewritten  pages of new data each day, in many different formats.
* Visualization. To make the data useful for researchers  sitting at their terminals, the REINAS team has created several  striking graphics tools. For instance, "Spray" is a program in which  the user injects smart particles, or "sparts," into a graphic to  visualize a 3-D data set in a particular way. For example, ribbons of  color might illuminate contours of barometric pressure over the bay.  "CSpray" is a means via which two users at distant sites can  collaborate on looking at different aspects of the same data set at  the same time. A more modest tool for displaying simple  meteorological data on 2-D plots is available to any user over the  World Wide Web. This access to REINAS data is popular with surfers  and other recreational users who want to know current ocean  conditions. Another successful public service is the SlugVideo Home  Page, a wireless digital video feed from atop the ten-story Dream  Inn in Santa Cruz that provides updated views of the coast via the  World Wide Web.

"A major challenge in visualization is to pull together the  diverse sets of data and put them into pictures so that a researcher  can get a synthesized view," Mantey says. "Computer graphics can  present pretty pictures, but they must be carefully designed so that  the user gets a true understanding of the physical phenomena."

Just as important, he notes, are the "metadata" inherent in  REINAS data bases--"data about the data," explaining how the  information was gathered. "That eliminates the need for scientists  to have access to each other's notebooks," Mantey says. "It's a  systematic way of having the data make sense to everyone, and it  prevents much duplication of effort in processing the raw data."

Beyond the scientific applications of forecasting and modeling  the weather, Mantey envisions that REINAS eventually will prove  useful for operational tasks such as guiding rescue fleets,  responding to oil spills, and improving immediate storm warnings  under rapidly changing conditions. Nor should REINAS be limited to  Monterey Bay, he adds: "The REINAS architecture can work anywhere.  We could build a super-REINAS out of individual networks and expand  our coverage to a much larger region, such as the entire coast."
