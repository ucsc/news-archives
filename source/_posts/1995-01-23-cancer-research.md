SANTA CRUZ, CA--In 1992, a citizens' group called the National  Breast Cancer Coalition led a fight for more money from the federal  government for breast-cancer studies. Congress responded with  $210 million, but directed that the funds come from an unusual  source: the U.S. Army. Now, despite misgivings about the military's  intent, hundreds of scientists have earned grants for new and  potentially valuable research.

One of those scientists is Charles Daniel, research professor  of biology at UC Santa Cruz. Daniel's lab group will receive nearly  $1.1 million over the next four years to pursue basic research on  genetic changes in cells that may cause breast cancer. As part of the  project, Dominican Santa Cruz Hospital will supply the group with  tissue samples from the diseased breasts of women who undergo  surgery--tissues that otherwise would be discarded.

"Cancer is probably the most complex and challenging health  problem that scientists have grappled with," says Daniel, a founding  faculty member at UCSC. "Our research is part of a broad effort to  understand the basic processes behind breast cancer. These  approaches do not offer an immediate hope for curing cancer, but  they may lead to an arsenal of tests that would help identify people  at high risk."

The crux of Daniel's project is to explore the roles of special  genetic controls, called "homeobox genes," in the growth of both  normal and cancerous breasts. Homeobox genes are the master  regulators of the fate of a living cell. Studies in fruit flies and mice  have shown that these genes dictate basic body patterns in a  developing embryo, such as wiring of the nervous system or  placement of arms and legs. Errors in homeobox genes can cause  changes in the cell that damage or kill the embryo. It appears that  homeobox genes control proper tissue growth in adults as well. If  the genes somehow go haywire, cancer may result.

Recently, Daniel's lab group was the first to show that  homeobox genes are active in breast tissues. The group, led by  graduate student Yael Friedmann, studied the mammary glands of  mice. They found that certain homeobox genes switch on or off in the  glands, in response to changes in the levels of estrogen and other  key hormones. Moreover, mice with breast tumors had homeobox  genes that may function abnormally. Friedmann and her colleagues  reported their findings in November in the journal Cancer Research.

The Army-funded project will expand upon this work. Again  using mice, Daniel's team will study which of the dozens of known  homeobox genes control breast growth and function at various  stages of life. By inducing changes in some of the genes, the team  will try to learn whether they can act as cancer-causing triggers.  This could happen if the genes go into overdrive or shut down  prematurely.

The tissue samples from Dominican Hospital will allow the  team to extend its work to human breast cancer. Although cells in  people and mice work in similar ways, there probably are some  differences in how homeobox genes behave in the two species. The  researchers will not preserve the human tissues in a living state.  Rather, they will extract genetic material from normal and  cancerous cells, then study it using the techniques of molecular  biology.

For Daniel, who participated last year in UC's early-retirement  program, the Army grant has prolonged his research career. His group  recently received another new four-year grant from the National  Institutes of Health for a different aspect of research on mammary  glands in mice. "We are one of the few labs in the world working at  the intersection of homeobox genes and breast cancer," Daniel says.  "My goal is to establish a foundation for this kind of research and let  others assume the reins in four years."

Daniel emphasizes that his team's work is far removed from  creating a new medicine for breast cancer or manipulating the body's  genes to prevent it. "The whole medical establishment is based on  understanding how things work at a very basic level, and for breast  cancer that is not well known," he says. "Learning more about which  genes control these processes might help us detect people at risk.  That's a big promise--prevention is much more important than a cure  when it comes to cancer."

Although applying to the Army for money was not a simple  task, Daniel is pleased with the result: one of the largest grants of  his long tenure at UCSC. "Women activists pushed this program, and  it's encouraging that they got such a positive response," he says.  Legislators seem encouraged as well; Congress recently earmarked  $115 million in the Army's 1995 budget for a second round of  breast-cancer research proposals.
