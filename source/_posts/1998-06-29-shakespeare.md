title: The Day Shakespeare To Go Stood Still
author: Barbara McKenna

Some UCSC students took the expression "get the show on the road" in earnest recently.

The students, performers with Shakespeare To Go, recently found themselves stuck on Highway 17 in stand-still traffic caused by an overturned truck at the summit. The troupe was en route to a morning performance at Fair Middle School in East San Jose and, when it became clear they weren't going anywhere for some time, the students took to the roof of the van and performed Shakespeare monologues and scenes from _Much Ado About Nothing,_ the show they were touring.

Although some commuters weren't quite sure what to make of the show, many appreciative drivers rolled down their windows and enjoyed the diversion.

Shakespeare To Go is a collaborative education program sponsored by UCSC and Shakespeare Santa Cruz.
