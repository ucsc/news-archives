SANTA CRUZ, CA--Frederick H. Siff has been named associate vice  chancellor of Communications and Technology Services at the  University of California, Santa Cruz. The appointment, which takes  effect May 23, was announced today (April 6) by vice chancellor for  Business and Administrative Services Ed Coate.

Siff comes to UCSC from George Mason University in Fairfax,  Virginia, where he was vice president for University Computing and  Information Systems and a professor of applied and engineering  statistics and computer science. Siff has been at George Mason  University since he joined the faculty as an assistant professor in  1972.

"Fred Siff's background makes him an excellent choice for this  position," says Coate. "As the senior campus official in charge of  computing and technology, he'll be working with faculty, staff, and  students to ensure that UCSC is equipped with state-of-the-art  facilities. It's a job that requires leadership, vision, and strong  planning skills, all of which Fred has in abundance. I look forward to  working with him."

In his new role, Siff will manage the centralized computing  and communication services for the campus, including emergency  dispatching services. As part of UCSC's major commitment to the  use of computers for instruction, Siff will promote faculty use of  computers and modern multimedia technology in the classroom and  student use of computer labs. As the senior administrator for  information technology, Siff will manage a fixed operating budget of  approximately $3.5 million and will be responsible for long-range  planning. The campus computer network links more than 2,000  computer terminals and workstations, and the central telephone  system services approximately 2,500 lines.

Siff replaces Alan Schlenger, who retired from UCSC. Patrick  LeCuyer, assistant director of Administrative Information Systems,  has filled the position on an acting basis since Dec. 14, 1993.
