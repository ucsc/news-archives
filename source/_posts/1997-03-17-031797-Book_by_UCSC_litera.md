## I realized that I was not, in fact, pressing the computer's buttons at all--the  computer was pressing mine. \-- Scott Seguin

SANTA CRUZ, CA--That comment, excerpted from e-mail written by a  student in his Semiotics and Psychoanalysis class, was exactly what Earl  Jackson Jr. wanted to hear. A literature professor at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, Jackson added a new dimension to his course last  year by involving interactive computer work. Jackson's students were  required to send assignments by e-mail and to obtain various course  materials from a specially designed World Wide Web site. Both the midterm  and the final exam were taken through the Web. Exams, course work, and  class discussions--all hyperlinked--appeared on the Web as the term  progressed.

"My hope," Jackson said, "was that my students would feel stimulated  and encouraged to play an active and creative role in their own education."  The class worked so well that Jackson has created individual Web sites for  each of his subsequent courses as well as for previous classes. There are 13  courses online so far.

Jackson has distilled his knowledge about the new technologies into a  comprehensive and user-friendly book, College Connections Web Directory  1997\. The book is written for high school students, college students,  graduate students, re-entry students, and lifelong learners, as well as  educators and researchers.

The 388-page book is supplemented by a multiplatform CD-ROM  (meaning it is usable on both the Macintosh and PCs). The CD includes a fully  hyperlinked version of the entire text, Internet Explorer 3.0, College Link  software, additional narrative material, and the Web version of Jackson's  Detective Fictions course. Published this winter by Lycos Press and Ziff- Davis (an imprint of Macmillan Computer Publishing), the book/CD-ROM set  costs $29.99.

Jackson said he wrote the book because, "I wanted to help people get  over their fear and their awe of the Internet. It's neither a monster nor a  miracle. It won't harm you, but it also does not replace real work and real  efforts by real people to understand each other. The Net is only a metaphor  for a communications link. What's important is the people on all the nodes of  those networks, and what they do with these new possibilities."

The first chapters of the book present step-by-step instructions on  how to get "plugged in." Every facet of the Internet is explained clearly and  with great humor and helpful historical notes and anecdotes from Jackson's  experiences online and in the classroom. Other chapters outline various  searching procedures and compare the many search engines and reference  tools for their usefulness and efficiency.

Other sections of the book provide such resources as a complete  listing of four-year colleges and universities; a comprehensive listing of  higher educational resources for lifelong learners and reentry students; and  a reference guide for researchers and educators on how to integrate Web  resources into academic work and courses.

The practical side of the Internet is represented through several  extended hands-on operations. The book follows high school students  searching for the right college, preparing for admissions and aptitude tests,  and figuring the costs and the potential for financial aid--all online.

Next, the book demonstrates how the Internet can extend the student's  research capabilities far beyond the usual library shelf. Interactive  multimedia educational sites are showcased from the hard sciences to the  social sciences.

Woven throughout College Connections are e-mail conversations,  stories, and anecdotes between Jackson and his students, colleagues, and  friends. "These frame the technology and provide a human element to this  brave new world," Jackson said.

A Web neophyte just one year ago, Jackson saw the potential of the  medium as a teaching and communication tool. Before long he had not only  mastered the basics, but realized, as he explained it, "There is remarkable  potential for learning and for creating communities through the Web as long  as people realize their responsibility in accessing it creatively, and not  passively, as if it were a computer game or cybernetic television. It's  interactive--that's the crucial thing."

Jackson is the author of a number of publications, including Strategies  of Deviance: Studies in Gay Male Representation (1995); Fantastic Living:  The Speculative Autobiographies of Samuel R. Delany (forthcoming); and  essays in the collections Names We Call Home: Autobiographies in Racial  Identity (1995) and Beyond a Dream Deferred: Multicultural Education and  the Politics of Difference (1994) (which won the Gustavus Meier Foundation  Award for Outstanding Contribution to Human Rights). His areas of expertise  include semiotics, Japanese literature, psychoanalysis, Buddhist studies,  science fiction, and film theory.
