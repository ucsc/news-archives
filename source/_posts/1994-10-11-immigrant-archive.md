**Celebrations Of The Work Of Local Philanthropist William Mackenzie Set For October 23 In Santa Cruz And November 6 In Pebble Beach**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--For much of his life, William Mackenzie was  concerned with the prospects of the children of immigrants and  migrant workers. A Monterey Bay Area resident, Mackenzie made it  his mission to help those children attend college.

Mackenzie, who died in 1993, was an investment banker in the  1930s. He first became aware of the obstacles children of migrant  farmworkers faced in gaining an education when he returned from  service in World War II to ranch in the San Juan Bautista area. He  became passionate about educating disadvantaged children-- mentoring students, working with teachers and counselors, obtaining  scholarship funds, and, in 1979 founding the Migration and  Adaptation in the Americas Foundation (MAIA).

An archive that documents much of Mackenzie's research and  correspondence on the topic of the education of immigrants and  farmworkers has been established at Special Collections in the  University Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Two events are planned to celebrate the archive, one at UCSC  and one at the Robert Louis Stevenson School in Pebble Beach--the  area Mackenzie retired to. The first event takes place at 3 p.m.  on Sunday, October 23, in UCSC's Special Collections at McHenry  Library. The second takes place at  3 p.m. on Sunday, November 6, at The Gallery in the Samuel F. B.  Morse Fine Arts Center at Robert Louis Stevenson School.

The archive--donated by Mackenzie's widow, Shirley  Mackenzie--includes Mackenzie's extensive correspondence with  educators and the students he mentored, as well as videos and books  of clippings he compiled on migration of populations and education- related topics. The archive will complement the already extensive  collection of regional history materials housed in the University  Library and will serve as an excellent resource for scholars.  Already, two postdoctoral researchers are using the archive to learn  more about ways to encourage students to continue their studies.

Members of Mackenzie's family, as well as former students  who Mackenzie mentored, will attend both celebrations. Amado  Padilla, a professor of education at Stanford University, will speak  at the October 23 event, while Carmel photographer S. Beth Atkin  will attend the November 6 event. Both events are free and open to  the public.

Both events will feature an exhibition of selected photographs  by Atkin that appear in her book Voices from the Fields: Children of  Migrant Farmworkers Tell Their Stories (Boston: Little, Brown & Co.,  1993). Atkin's photographs will be on display at UCSC from October  23 through November 19, and at Robert Louis Stevenson School from  November 6 through December 8.

Mackenzie helped students on both a personal and an  organizational level. He formed the MAIA Foundation along with the  late Hubert Wyckoff, a Watsonville lawyer, to help educate the  public on issues concerning immigrant and migrant workers. MAIA,  which is headquartered in Watsonville and serves Santa Cruz and  Monterey counties, also provides start-up grants to other groups  serving migrants and immigrants. MAIA is just one project  Mackenzie was instrumental in launching. He was also a leading  proponent of outreach programs that provide academic support and  scholarships to minority students at Cabrillo, Hartnell, and Gavilan  colleges.

On a personal level, Mackenzie worked in partnership with  retired Watsonville High School counselor Mike Sullivan to help send  some 70 students off to college. To this end, Mackenzie spoke with  the students, lobbied on their behalf at college and university  admissions offices, met with their families, and connected them  with other area students who had gone on to college.

His personal involvement with area students was boundless. A  friend recalls the time Mackenzie received a call from one of his  proteges, then a freshman at Princeton University (Mackenzie's alma  mater). The distraught student confided to Mackenzie that he was  having such difficulty with a term paper that he was considering  dropping out. Although it was 2 a.m., Mackenzie immediately called  Andrea Watson, another of his proteges at Princeton. "He told me, 'Go  over there and tell him he can do it!'" recalls Watson, now a student  at Harvard Business School. And so, Watson obliged--getting dressed  and trudging through the snow in the middle of the night. Not only did  the student finish his term paper, he stayed in school and earned his  degree.
