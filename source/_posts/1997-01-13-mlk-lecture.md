SANTA CRUZ, CA--Cornel West will address American race relations in the  context of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s, life and legacy at the thirteenth  annual Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial Convocation at the University of  California, Santa Cruz. This year's convocation in memory of the slain civil  rights leader takes place on Monday, January 27, at 4 P.M. in the Performing  Arts Theater.

An author, philosopher, and professor of the philosophy of religion and  Afro-American studies at Harvard University, West discussed the subjects  of race and race relations in a best-selling 1993 book, Race Matters. In  West's keynote speech of the same name, he will discuss the "collapse of  meaning" and the consequences of economic decline, cultural decay, and  political lethargy in American life.

Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood will deliver opening remarks, and  Professor Angela Davis will introduce West. Admission is free, but tickets  are required and available in advance from the UCSC Ticket Office (see  ticketing information below).

Open to the general public, the convocation honors the memory of Dr.  King with speakers, music, and a keynote address.

West, whom the director of Harvard's Department of Afro-American  Studies described in emerge magazine as "the pre-eminent African- American intellectual of our time," rose to prominence from modest  beginnings.

Born in 1953 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to a civilian Air Force administrator  and an elementary school teacher, West later moved with his family to  Sacramento.

During his childhood in Sacramento, he was influenced by both the  Baptist church and the Black Panthers. From his early involvement in the  church, West gained a strong spiritual center and the foundation for his  dramatic speaking style. From the Black Panthers, who had an office near his  church, West says he began to understand about the importance of  community-based political action.

Yet, it was a biography of Teddy Roosevelt that steered his academic  future. In the biography, eight-year-old West read that, like himself, the  former president had suffered from asthma. He learned that Roosevelt  overcame his asthma, went to Harvard University, and became a great  speaker. West decided to follow Roosevelt to Harvard.

A dozen years later, after spending three years at Harvard, West  graduated magna cum laude. He went on to study at Princeton University,  where he received his M.A. in 1975 and his Ph.D. in 1980. In 1988, after  teaching at schools including Yale University's Divinity School, the Union  Theological Seminary, and Barnard College, he returned to Princeton to  direct the Afro-American Studies Program and teach religion. In 1994, he  joined the faculty at Harvard.

At Harvard's Department of Afro-American Studies, West is part of a  select faculty, described by Peter Applebome of the New York Times as  "perhaps the most celebrated assortment of scholars in America."

In addition to Race Matters, West has written numerous books about  race, politics, and philosophy, including Breaking Bread: Insurgent Black  Intellectual Life (1991), a book he cowrote with author and UCSC alumna  bell hooks. hooks (who writes her name entirely in lower-case letters)  delivered the keynote address for UCSC's 1995 Martin Luther King  convocation. West cowrote his most recent book, The Future of the Race  (1996), with Henry Louis Gates, Jr., who directs Harvard's Department of  Afro-American Studies.

At the convocation, the Reverend Robert Renfro of the Progressive  Missionary Baptist Church in Santa Cruz will offer an invocation, and UCSC  junior Catina Wilson will deliver the student welcome. LaTasha Folk, also a  junior, will join admissions counselor Adrienne Harrell in a duet. The  convocation will also be broadcast live at the Performing Arts Concert Hall,  where overflow seating is available, and at Kresge College Town Hall.

A reception at E-100 Performing Arts will follow the event. Parking is  free in the Performing Arts parking lot during the event, but space is  limited. Call (408) 459-2159 for more information.

Beginning at noon on Wednesday, January 22, tickets will be available  at no cost at the UCSC Ticket Office. Also beginning at that time, tickets  may be reserved by phone; those wishing to attend are strongly encouraged  to reserve tickets in person as demand is expected to be high. There is a  two-ticket-per-person limit. People with disability-related needs are asked  to indicate those needs when they request tickets.

The convocation is presented by Arts & Lectures and the Division of  Student Affairs.
