![\[photo of joel primack\]][2]Professor of physics **Joel Primack** and his wife **Nancy Ellen Abrams** were recognized by the Templeton Exemplary Papers Program for "In a Beginning... Quantum Cosmology and Kabbalah," an article they published in the January/February 1995 issue of _Tikkun,_ a bimonthly Jewish critique of politics, culture, and society. The article earned an award as an exemplary paper in humility theology for 1996 in the category of theology and the natural sciences. Both Primack and Abrams received $1,000 for the honor. The John Templeton Foundation, which sponsors the award program, also funded a popular UCSC course taught by Primack and Abrams, _Cosmology and Culture,_ offered in winter 1996 as Crown 80C and in winter 1997 as Physics 80C. Further, Primack is advising the Templeton Foundation on a project called "Science and the Spiritual Quest," which will bring together physicists and cosmologists--including several Nobel laureates--for workshops and a conference in 1997-98.
