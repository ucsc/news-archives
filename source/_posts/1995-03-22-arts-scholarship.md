SANTA CRUZ--Holly Cardoza has been named as the recipient of the  1994-95 Priscilla Newton Undergraduate Scholarship in Theater  Arts, given annually at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

A senior who has acted and directed in numerous productions  at UCSC, Cardoza designed her own major in performance studies,  which allows her to pursue scholarly as well as performance  aspects of theater. Cardoza recently directed an adaptation of The  Myth of Isis and Osiris for children. The production just completed a  successful tour of twelve Santa Cruz County elementary schools. She  also adapted and directed The War in Heaven and has acted in a  number of plays at UCSC, including Alice in Wonderland, Phaedra,  Biomechanoid, and Leigh's Outrunning her Mefa and Pefa Tonight.

She is the fourth student to receive support from the  scholarship, which totals $3,100 this year. Recipients are chosen by  committee on the basis of merit and need, with preference  given to women.

The scholarships are made possible through an endowment  established in 1991 by Dr. Bernard Oliver in honor of his wife  Priscilla Newton. A leading actress, Newton landed her first major  role while in college, playing Emily in a Broadway production of Our  Town.

This award is especially important as financial support for the  arts decreases. Cardoza says she has valued the award for both the  financial security it has provided and because it is an affirmation of  her work and encouragement to pursue her goals. Her goals include  obtaining a Ph.D. in directing and theory, pursuing an academic  career, and starting a theater company.
