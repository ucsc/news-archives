Zhiwu Zhu will become a faculty member in the planned Environmental Toxicology Department when that degree program is established. He uses yeast cells to study the biochemistry and molecular biology of metal ions such as copper, which can trigger disease at abnormal levels. Zhu earned his B.S. from Nanjing Teachers University and his M.S. from Zheng Zhou University, both in China, and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Michigan Medical School.
