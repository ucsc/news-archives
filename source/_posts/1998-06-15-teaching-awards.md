A UCSC academic committee has selected the recipients of the 1997-98 Excellence in Teaching Awards. The 11 professors and lecturers were nominated for the award by students, who described their teachers as inspirational, enthusiastic, and passionate.

Chancellor Greenwood presented each winner with a framed certificate and a $500 award at a ceremony at University House earlier this month.

In selecting the award recipients, the Committee on Teaching evaluated nomination letters from students, endorsement letters from department chairs, and statements on teaching from the nominees themselves. The Committee on Teaching views the Excellence in Teaching Awards as an important act of peer recognition for colleagues whose work as instructors is exemplary and inspiring.
