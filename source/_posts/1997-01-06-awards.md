The Environmental Studies Board has announced this year's winners of the David Gaines Memorial Awards: **Radovan Dluhy-Smith,** a senior with a double major in environmental studies and global economics, received $600 for a study examining the economic and environmental impacts of commercial agriculture controlled by the Mixtec people in Oaxaca, Mexico; and **Janell Hillman,** a senior majoring in environmental studies, received $400 for her work examining the allelopathic effects of poison hemlock on native plant revegetation at Wilder Ranch State Park. The awards, which support field projects in environmental studies, were established in 1989 in honor of alumnus and environmentalist David Gaines (Crown '69) by his aunt. Gaines, who led the fight to save Mono Lake, was killed in an automobile accident in 1988.
