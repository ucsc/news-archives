**Chancellor Greenwood** was named one of the top five news makers of 1997 by the Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau. The bureau selected Greenwood for her efforts to bridge the gap between conventional farming and the university's students and faculty, whose emphasis on sustainable and organic agriculture has at times put them at odds with conventional agriculture. One of Greenwood's first official acts after arriving at UCSC in July 1996 was to attend the annual Farm Bureau dinner. She was the first UCSC chancellor to accept the invitation. Her other activities included touring several Pajaro Valley farms, doing more outreach with growers, and hosting a tour of the UCSC Farm for Farm Bureau members.
