![\[Photo of Chancellor Greenwood and parents at move-in\]][1] A number of activities took place in late September, welcoming students to the new academic year. Chancellor Greenwood, who  participated in many of them, was on hand during move-in weekend September 25-26 to greet new and returning  students--and their parents.

![\[Photo of Chancellor Greenwood and UCSC undergrad\]][2] More than 550 undergraduates attended Chancellor Greenwood's reception at University House on September 27. In the photo (right) a student shares her ideas with the chancellor. The following day, 200 graduate students attended a similar reception.

The students paid $10 each for a night of unlimited rides, food coupons, and special tickets for games such as laser tag and miniature golf. A number of UCSC staff and faculty joined the fun.
