Chancellor Greenwood joined the deans of UCSC's academic divisions last month to honor 42 undergraduates for academically outstanding achievement. The undergraduates were recipients of the Dean's Undergraduate Achievement Awards, which recognize outstanding scholarship and creativity based on work by the award winners (for example a senior thesis or a painting).

Twelve of the Dean's Award winners also received Chancellor's Undergraduate Achievement Awards as the highest-rated Dean's Award recipients. The award winners received $100 and a certificate for each award.
