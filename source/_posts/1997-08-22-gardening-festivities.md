SANTA CRUZ, CA--Thirty years ago, on a scrub-covered hillside of  the young UC Santa Cruz campus, Alan Chadwick planted a revolution  in gardening. The iconoclastic Englishman was a pioneer of organic,  French-intensive gardening in northern California, and his influence  has made its way from that steep hillside to farms around the world  and to the tables of the nation's finest restaurants.

The training program Chadwick founded at UCSC has launched  hundreds of students on careers in organic farming and gardening,  environmental education, community development, the natural foods  business, and international agricultural training programs.

UC Santa Cruz is celebrating Chadwick's legacy with a three-day anniversary celebration October 3-5 featuring a special  anniversary edition of the popular annual Harvest Festival, a  symposium highlighting the activities of graduates of UCSC's unique  training program in organic farming and gardening, and an all-organic benefit dinner (see attached schedule of events for a full  listing).

Chadwick was an advocate of gardening without synthetic  chemicals or pesticides, and his techniques for producing abundance  from limited space have been transported literally around the world  by UCSC graduates. His emphasis on high-quality, organically  produced food has been embraced by a generation of American cooks  and has helped fuel the excitement over California cuisine.

The informal apprenticeship begun by Chadwick in 1967 gave  rise to the UCSC Farm and Garden Apprenticeship and UCSC's Center  for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. More than 800 people  have participated in the apprenticeship, a six-month residential  training program for people interested in acquiring the skills and  knowledge needed to grow crops with ecologically sound methods.  Center staff and faculty conduct research on organic farming  techniques and social issues in sustainable agriculture and are  internationally known for their contributions to these fields.

Among those who will gather October 3-5 to honor Chadwick's  contributions and celebrate 30 years of UCSC's apprenticeship  program are farmers, educators, chefs, wholesale produce buyers,  and former Peace Corps volunteers who have helped spread  Chadwick's vision. Among the former UCSC apprentices who will  participate in an alumni symposium on Sunday, October 5, are Martha  Boyd (1993) of The Food Project, a youth development program in  Boston; Cathrine Sneed (1987) director of The Garden Project, a  garden training program for prisoners in San Francisco; David  Brodkey (1986), a teacher at Alianza Elementary School in  Watsonville; Liza Buckner (1987) of St. Anthony's Farm in Petaluma,  a horticultural therapy program for people in rehabilitation; and Carl  Elliot (1985), a Seattle-based urban gardening instructor and host of  a radio talk show on gardening.
