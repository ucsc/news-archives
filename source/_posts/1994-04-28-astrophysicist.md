SANTA CRUZ, CA--When thoughts turn to dramatic leaps forward in  the history of astronomy, the names Copernicus and Galileo come to  mind. But Freeman Dyson would like us to remember Bradley and  Zwicky as well.

Dyson, a visionary author and one of the world's leading  theoretical astrophysicists, will discuss advances inspired by these  and other less famous figures during "Revolutions in Astronomy," a  free public lecture on Thursday, May 26, at UC Santa Cruz. Dyson's  talk will begin at 8 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2.

James Bradley devised finely calibrated instruments in the  1700s for measuring the positions of stars and other objects, says  Dyson. "Bradley was the first person who actually measured things  accurately, and his accuracy was unbelievable for the time," he says.  "He created the science of high precision." Later, Fritz Zwicky  devised new ways of surveying the sky in the 1930s. "Zwicky was  the discoverer of the universe's missing mass," Dyson says. "He was  a technician who understood tools. Revolutions are generally the  results of new tools."

Dyson also plans to discuss more recent and current  revolutions. For example, a technique known as "adaptive optics"  promises to cancel out the blurring effects of the earth's  atmosphere, allowing telescopes on the ground to see as sharply as  those in space. If time permits, Dyson may speculate about  revolutions to come.

A native of Berkshire, England, Dyson has been a professor of  physics since 1953 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,  New Jersey. He has written numerous thought-provoking books,  including Disturbing the Universe, From Eros to Gaia, Infinite in All  Directions, and Weapons and Hope, which won the National Book  Critics Circle Award for nonfiction in 1984.

Dyson's visit is sponsored by UCO/Lick Observatory and the  Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at UCSC. His talk is part  of the ongoing Delphasus Lecture Series, funded by a private gift to  UCSC to increase public appreciation of issues in astronomy and  physics.
