title: Females And Males May Continually Coevolve In An Antagonistic Dance, According To Study On Fruit Flies

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Longtime viewers of "60 Minutes" may recall the  weekly segment known as "Point Counterpoint," in which a female  and a male commentator put up their intellectual dukes over issues  of the day. Even those wise pundits could not have realized how  closely their verbal sparring resembled a genetic joust of the sexes  that, says biologist William Rice, happens all around us and has  helped drive the evolution of every species on earth.

Rice, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz,  found evidence of surprising sexual one-upsmanship during a clever  lab experiment using tens of thousands of fruit flies. His  experimental setup and a bag of genetic tricks let Rice freeze the  evolution of female flies as the males evolved through 41  generations. With time, the males became "supermales," prodigiously  successful at passing on their improved genes to their sons--but at  the expense of their female mates, who succumbed to increasingly  toxic seminal fluid.

Females and males within all species, including humans, may  continually evolve new genetic strategies to gain a leg up on each  other, says Rice. However, this "sexually antagonistic coevolution"  would happen slowly in nature and would be hard to observe. Each  sex would adapt to changes in the other, preserving an uneasy  balance--much as each member of a waltzing pair holds still,  relative to the other person, even though they both sweep across the  dance floor.

By pinning half of each fruit-fly pair in place evolutionarily,  Rice exposed the dance of the males. "The two sexes are an  important part of each other's environment," he says. "They evolve  substantially in response to one another, not just in response to the  physical environment or to predators and competitors. This point- counterpoint kind of evolution can happen perpetually, and it may  play a critical role in splitting one species off from another."

Rice's study appears in the May 16 issue of the journal Nature.  His paper is accompanied by a "News and Views" commentary from  Linda Partridge and Tracey Chapman of University College London,  leading researchers in the field.

Rice used fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) for his work  because they breed quickly--each generation lasts just two weeks-- and because scientists have devised useful techniques to manipulate  their genes. Several of these tools let Rice build a population of  male flies that evolved from generation to generation while mating  with females genetically identical to those in the first batch.

Each generation began with about 800 male flies. Rice mated  these with about 600 females, making detailed observations of their  mating behaviors and how long they survived after mating. From the  thousands of offspring, he chose 800 sons with the desired genetic  characteristics and began the process anew. The experiment lasted  more than eighteen months.

After 30 generations, Rice saw strong evidence that his  "supermales" had emerged. Their fitness as fathers--defined by Rice  as their ability to leave more male descendants for the next  generation--went up by 24 percent over the first generation of  males. So, for every four adult male sons produced by fathers in the  first batch of flies, the supermales spawned five sons. (Supermales  also sired more daughters, but only the sons carried the full genetic  complement of interest to Rice.)

By every other measure, Rice says, the supermales were  superior. For instance, when Rice introduced competitor males into  the fray to mate the females, the supermale flies remated the  females more frequently. Further, their sperm continued to fertilize  the eggs of the females at a higher rate, even after Rice let the  females mate with competitor males.

The success of the supermales took its toll on their female  partners. Many more females died prematurely as the generations  wore on. "Seminal fluid is toxic to female flies," Rice says. "The  more they mate, the faster they die." Indeed, evolutionary  adaptations in the supermales seemed to boost the toxicity of their  seminal fluid--a genetically based change that led to more  supermales in the next generation, with a deadly cost to females.  The fact that more females died after bearing their offspring was of  no consequence to the supermales, whose sole goals in life already  had been realized.

All of these measurements, Rice says, painted a convincing  picture of sexually antagonistic coevolution among his winged  charges. In nature, he suspects, female flies would counteract any  genetic movement toward supermales by evolving some way of  making the seminal fluid less toxic to them. However, researchers  don't yet know how that might occur.

"These molecular interactions can go on indefinitely," Rice  says. "Because they occur at the level of simple gene products,  there's no physical constraint to prevent the point-counterpoint  adaptations from going on forever." In that light, he concludes,  biologists should consider sexually antagonistic coevolution as one  of the major driving forces behind the origin of new species--a field  of study in which new theories often fly as fast and furious as one  of Rice's supermales.

Rice's research was funded by a grant from the National  Science Foundation.
