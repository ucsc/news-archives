SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Crow's Nest restaurant on the shores of  Monterey Bay will support public education programs at another  well-known bayside institution, the Long Marine Laboratory, with  "Cheers at the Crow's Nest," a benefit holiday celebration on  Thursday, December 7.

For all diners who state their support for Long Marine Lab, the  Crow's Nest will donate one-third of the dinner proceeds between  5:30 and 8:30 p.m. to the Friends of Long Marine Lab. The friends  group also will receive one-third of all bar proceeds from 7:30 to  11:30 p.m. Wally's Jazz Quartet will provide live music during the  evening.

Six guest bartenders will assist the Crow's Nest staff: Steve  Davenport, assistant director of the UC Santa Cruz Institute of  Marine Sciences (IMS), which operates Long Marine Lab; IMS research  specialists Rob Franks and Geoff Smith; IMS administrative  assistant Doreen Cepeda; Long Marine Lab dolphin trainer Billy  Hurley; and Judy Nickelson, member of the Friends of Long Marine Lab  Board of Directors.

Reservations and information are available from Lisa M. Rose,  executive director of the Friends of Long Marine Lab, at 459-3694,  or from the lab's main office at 459-2883. Diners also may call the  Crow's Nest at 476-4560 for reservations.

Public programs at Long Marine Lab attract about 40,000  people each year, including schoolchildren from throughout central  California. The programs focus on marine research, the Monterey Bay  environment, and careers in marine science and biology. The Friends  of Long Marine Lab is in the midst of raising funds for a planned $4.4  million Visitor Education Center, which will substantially enhance  the lab's ability to educate the public.
