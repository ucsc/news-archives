SANTA CRUZ, CA--Public educators at Long Marine Lab invite community  members with an interest in marine science to join an upcoming training  course for volunteer docents. The two-month series of classes will begin in  January.

Docents spend at least six hours a month teaching the public and  schoolchildren about the Monterey Bay environment and marine research at  Long Marine Lab. Operated by UC Santa Cruz, the lab attracts about 40,000  visitors each year for tours and educational programs.

The course offers training in interpretive skills and basic marine  biology, along with informative presentations on current research projects.  Docents are especially needed to work on weekday mornings or weekend  afternoons.

Evening classes will occur in January and February, followed by a  three-week apprenticeship. Space is limited in the training course, which  costs $40. The application deadline is Wednesday, November 27.

Docent coordinators will hold a special orientation session for  interested applicants at Long Marine Lab on Monday, October 21, at 6 P.M.

For more information, applicants may contact the lab's Education  Office at 459-3854.
