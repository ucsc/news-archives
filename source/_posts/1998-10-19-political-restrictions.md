title: Restrictions On The Use Of University Resources And Facilities For Political Activities
author: Office Of The President
---

The following basic guidelines, effective immediately, constitute Presidential policies governing the use of resources and facilities for political purposes or activities:  
1. The name, insignia, seal, or address of the University or any of its offices or units shall not be used for or in connection with political purposes or activity except as consistent with University regulations.  
2. In correspondence, statements, or other material relating to political activities or issues, the University title of a faculty or staff member shall be used only for identification; if such identification might reasonably be construed as implying the support, endorsement, or opposition of the University with regard to any political activity or issue, the identification shall be accompanied by an explicit statement that the individual is speaking for himself and not as a representative of the university or any of its offices or units.  
3. University equipment, supplies, and services--duplicating machines, telephones, mail* and messenger services, vehicles, computers, stationery, and other equipment, supplies, or services--shall not be used for or in connection with political purposes or activities. (This does not prohibit the incidental use of resources e.g., sound equipment, in connection with permitted use of University facilities.)
