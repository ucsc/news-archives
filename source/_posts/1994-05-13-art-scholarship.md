SANTA CRUZ--Twelve art students who are among the finest at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, will exhibit their work on  campus this month. The twelve are recipients of the 1993-94  William Hyde Irwin and Susan Benteen Irwin Scholarships, given  annually to outstanding young artists. The exhibit takes place in the  Porter Faculty Gallery, Room D-222, from May 18 to June 8, with an  opening reception on Wednesday, May 18, from 4 to 6 p.m.

The Irwin scholarship fund was established in 1986 through a  gift from Mrs. Irwin in memory of her late husband, an artist and  writer. When she died in 1990 the endowment totaled $500,000,  which provides $2,500 scholarships annually to up to thirteen  students in visual arts. Scholarships are awarded on the basis of  merit and need.

"These scholarships are quite significant--they provide some  of our most talented students with vital financial support and the  opportunity for public exposure and recognition," says Edward  Houghton, dean of UCSC's Division of the Arts. "This kind of financial  support furthers our goal to support and foster talented emerging  artists."

Susan Irwin, who was born in Watsonville, retired to Brookdale  with her husband in 1955. The two shared a lifelong interest in the  arts. William Irwin was a professional painter and Susan Irwin  taught art at San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State  University) from  1932 to 1947 and then served as supervisor of art for San Francisco  Unified School District.

"Susan Irwin received a scholarship to attend Columbia  University. It was scholarship support that allowed her to obtain her  doctorate, and she wanted to make that support available to the  students in her community," says Daniel Aldrich, assistant  chancellor for University Advancement.

The 1993-94 recipients are listed with their areas of interest  following in parentheses:
