United Press International spoke with physicist **Michael Nauenberg** about the London conference he helped to organize on Isaac Newton. The science and history conference, held on March 21, attracted the world's leading Newtonian scholars.

The _San Francisco Chronicle_ published a paean to _Pioneer 10,_ the most distant spacecraft from Earth. A diagram showed the famous plaque aboard the hardy craft, designed by our own **Frank Drake** and the late Carl Sagan as a greeting to civilizations that may encounter _Pioneer 10_ in the future.

The _Monterey County Herald_ reported on a lecture by marine biologist **Jim Estes** on California sea otters. Oil spills may no longer be the primary threat to the population, Estes said, noting that "there's little evidence that the [_Exxon Valdez]_ spill had a catastrophic long-term effect" on otters in Alaska.

Astronomer **Bill Mathews** shared commentary about Comet Hale-Bopp with the audience of Mr. Logic's weekly Sunday science program on KSCO radio. Mathews taught a popular winter-quarter course on Hale-Bopp and the possible role of meteorite impacts on the planet's evolution.
