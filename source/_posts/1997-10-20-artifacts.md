As of Saturday, the UCSC Archaeological Archives is home to a unique collection of prehistoric artifacts that date back between 7,000 and 10,000 years. The artifacts, which include ancient grinding stones and a very rare brown chert tool that resembles an arrowhead ([photo][5]), were recovered from a site near Scotts Valley City Hall that has produced the oldest artifacts found in the region.

"These artifacts are typical of remains found at the earliest human settlements in the state," said UCSC anthropology professor Diane Gifford-Gonzalez, curator of the archives.

A huge rescue excavation of the Scotts Valley site was launched by the Santa Cruz Archaeological Society in 1983 after the site was illegally bulldozed during development, said Gifford-Gonzalez, who was at the time the professional adviser to the group. More than 150 volunteers participated in the excavation, including UCSC students, professional archaeologists, and amateurs. The artifacts were recovered then and during subsequent research by Dr. Robert Cartier of Archaeological Resource Management in San Jose.

Funds for the curation are being donated by Cartier and the Santa Cruz Archaeological Society with Rob Edwards, director of the Archaeological Technology Program at Cabrillo College and the group's current professional adviser. UCSC student employees of the Archaeology Archives will curate the collection as on-the-job training during the next few years.

"This is the latest chapter in an ongoing story of cooperation between public and private sectors, involving a community-based organization, a private contractor, and two academic institutions--all focused on conserving an important part of our local heritage," said Gifford-Gonzalez.
