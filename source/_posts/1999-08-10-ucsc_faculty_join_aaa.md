## UCSC Faculty Win Leadership Positions In American Anthropological Assn.

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Two anthropologists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have been elected to leadership positions with the American Anthropological Association (AAA), bringing the leadership of the two largest professional anthropological societies under the guidance of UCSC faculty.

Donald Brenneis, chair of UCSC's Anthropology Department, was named president-elect of the AAA, the world's largest organization of individuals interested in anthropology. Brenneis, who will assume the position during the association's annual meeting in November, will be president-elect for two years before becoming president in 2001.

Patricia Zavella, a professor of community studies at UCSC, was elected to the executive board of the AAA. Founded in 1902, the AAA was formed to promote the science of anthropology and to coordinate the efforts of American anthropologists. Its membership exceeds 10,000, and annual meetings draw more than 5,000 people.

In addition, Susan Harding, a professor of anthropology at UCSC, is currently president-elect of the American Ethnological Society, the second- largest association for anthropologists and the leading organization for cultural anthropologists. Harding will assume the post of president in November.
