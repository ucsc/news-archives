Nannette O'Connor (left) of the Career Center and her coworkers presented each honoree with a certificate, Slug t-shirt, and canvas tote bag. Nearly 30 people attended, from companies and organizations including Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Coast Commercial Bank, and the City of Santa Cruz, and from on-campus offices such as the Economics Department and Educational Opportunity Programs.
