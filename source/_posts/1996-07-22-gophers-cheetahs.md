title: Humble Pocket Gophers Shed Light On The Genetic Fortitude Of Cheetahs

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The cheetah, spotted embodiment of feline grace  and power, races across African plains. The pocket gopher, small and  squat, scurries among tunnels in the American West. Unbeknownst to  either cheetah or gopher, research at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, has unveiled a common bond between them--and has  bolstered one side of a hot cheetah debate.

That bond is remarkable genetic similarity between  individuals within each species. Many scientists suspect that one  reason behind the decline of cheetahs is their lack of genetic  variation--a degree of sameness close to that seen in inbred  laboratory mice. Key evidence came from a surprising 1985  experiment in which unrelated captive cheetahs accepted skin grafts  from each other, a sign that their immune systems were genetically  almost identical. However, in recent years some ecologists have  questioned the validity of that work.

The UCSC study provides an independent check. Researchers M. A. Sanjayan and Kevin Crooks used pocket gophers in the first  attempt to repeat the 1985 experiment on wild animals. Just as  with the cheetahs, gophers in populations with little genetic  variation accepted skin grafts from one another. However, gophers  from a population with higher genetic diversity rejected skin grafts  from their neighbors--an experimental control that the 1985 study  lacked.

These results led Sanjayan and Crooks, both Ph.D. candidates in  biology, to conclude that the cheetah study was accurate.  Consequently, cheetahs and other genetically impoverished species,  such as California sea otters and elephant seals, may have little  variability among their immune systems and thus may be more  vulnerable to outbreaks of disease.

"Genetic variation is the stuff of evolution," says Sanjayan. "It  allows a population to adapt effectively to changes in the  environment. You exist at a price if you have low genetic variation.  It's like having lots of clones of yourself."

If animals within a population are similar to each other  immunologically, Sanjayan adds, "That doesn't bode well for disease  resistance. If a new disease arises, either they'll all be resistant or  they'll all be wiped out. You may not get a middle response, where at  least some individuals make it. That's something you'd expect with  other species."

Sanjayan and Crooks will present their work at a joint  meeting of the Ecological Society of America and the Society for  Conservation Biology, August 10-14 in Providence, Rhode Island.  They also published a synopsis of their findings in the June 13 issue  of the journal Nature.

Scientists led by geneticist Stephen O'Brien of the National  Cancer Institute began exploring the genetic troubles of cheetahs in  the early 1980s. Their skin-graft paper, published in Science on  March 22, 1985, greatly impacted the field of conservation biology.  The costs of genetic uniformity among cheetahs, the scientists  theorized, could include high rates of juvenile mortality, problems  with captive breeding, and greater risk of decimation by a virus or  other disease.

Some field ecologists doubt parts of O'Brien's analysis. They  point to apparent weaknesses in the design of the skin-graft  experiment; for instance, the researchers used skin from domestic  cats as a control. More profoundly, detractors argue that ecological  factors, such as habitat loss and predation, are more vital to  cheetahs' survival than genetic diversity. No one has found a direct  link, they say, between genetic shortcomings and the decline of  cheetahs or, for that matter, any other species.

The UCSC study does not address these latter concerns. It does,  however, show that inbred mammals can be so genetically alike that  their immune systems distinguish poorly between self and nonself.  The proof: The animals accept skin grafts--in effect, organ  transplants--from each other.

"No one had found another wild animal that could tolerate skin  transplants from other members of its species, so people  disbelieved the cheetah results," says conservation biology pioneer  Michael Soule, research professor of environmental studies at UCSC  and adviser to Sanjayan and Crooks. "We showed it could happen in a  natural population."

The team studied 44 animals from two populations of the  pocket gopher, Thomomys bottae, from Humboldt County in northern  California and a third group from the Carmel Valley. Gophers within  each of the northern populations were so similar genetically that a  DNA fingerprinting analysis by coworker David Foran could not  separate individuals. The Carmel Valley gophers had much higher  genetic variability, more typical of most mammals.

Each Humboldt gopher accepted grafts of small patches of skin  from other animals within its own population, whereas the Carmel  Valley gophers did not. To test whether the immune systems of the  Humboldt gophers functioned at all, the researchers grafted skin  from the Carmel Valley gophers onto a few of the Humboldt gophers;  the animals rejected them.

Soule notes that the range of genetic variation among different  populations of pocket gophers, from extremely low to extremely  high, makes Thomomys bottae an ideal model system for exploring  the costs of genetic uniformity to endangered species. His team now  is investigating the effects of low genetic variation among pocket  gophers on disease resistance, physiological fitness, and their  survival in the wild. Team members will present early results at the  August meeting.
