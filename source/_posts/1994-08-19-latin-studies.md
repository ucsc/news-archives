SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Latin American studies program at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, has been renamed Latin  American and Latino studies in a change that reflects the  integration of the study of Chicano and Latino populations within the  United States.

The new name is part of a reorganization designed to  encompass the study of Spanish-speaking people in the United States  and those of Latin American heritage, says program coordinator  Julianne Burton-Carvajal, a professor of Spanish literature. "We  needed to change the name and direction of the program to reflect  the centrality of cross-border studies," says Burton-Carvajal. "Area  studies as historically conceived was a by-product of cold war  geopolitics. The changes in name and orientation of our major  reflect new realities on the local, national, and international scene."

As part of a move toward gaining departmental status, the  curriculum and major have been expanded to include cross-border  issues that have developed with the emergence of "greater Latin  America"--a region that extends from the southwestern United  States to the southern tip of South America. Although the curriculum  will remain rooted in the historical phenomena that shaped the  region, the new, broader focus will allow students to address  contemporary issues such as globalization, transnationalization, and  the ways in which groups reproduce their regional culture in  binational settings.

The changes include the establishment of two overlapping  concentrations within the program for students who major in Latin  American and Latino studies. Students can choose to concentrate on  "politics and society," which has a social science focus, or on  "culture and society," which is largely oriented toward the arts and  humanities. In addition, students who choose the "intensive  concentration" do extensive course work in both areas. Students who  major in Latin American and Latino studies are required to speak,  read, and write in Spanish or Portuguese. Beginning this fall,  students will also have the option of declaring a minor in Latin  American and Latino studies.
