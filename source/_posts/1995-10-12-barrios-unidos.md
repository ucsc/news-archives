SANTA CRUZ--November is the month to apply for fall 1996  admission to the University of California. In an effort to provide  better admissions service to local students and increase the  eligibility and the number of applications to universities and  colleges, the UC Santa Cruz Admissions Office and Santa Cruz  Barrios Unidos have launched a new initiative: The University  Application and UC Eligibility Drive.

Barrios Unidos is a national coalition attempting to end barrio  warfare. The Santa Cruz center, located at 313 Front Street, places  a special emphasis on preventing violence among youths by providing  them with alternatives.

Services offered during the months of October and November  include application workshops; one-on-one advising and assistance  for students applying to college; one-on-one advising for seventh to  eleventh graders to prepare university-eligible high school course  plans; transfer student advising; assistance in writing application  statements; and information on financial aid, application fee  waivers, and tours of UCSC.

Bilingual staff will be available at all drop-in sessions.

Ninth through twelfth graders are encouraged to bring a copy  of their updated unofficial transcripts, which may be obtained from  their high school office.

Hours for the drive are as follows:
* October: Drop-in hours at the center will be Tuesdays and  Thursdays, from 3:30 to 7 p.m.
* November: Drop-in hours will be Mondays, Tuesdays, and  Thursdays, from 3:30 to 7 p.m. Additional workshops will be held on  Saturday, November 4, and Saturday, November 18.
* Other: Transfer student advising will be on Tuesdays and  Thursdays, from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m.

UC's fall 1996 application filing period begins November 1 and  ends November 30, 1995.
