SANTA CRUZ, CA--What does hip-hop have in common with the  waltz? What about the watusi and the tango? All of these popular  forms of social dance will be featured in Dancetime!, a unique  theatrical performance that traverses 500 years of dance, complete  with period costumes and music.

Across the centuries, social dance has figured prominently in  the rituals of courtship between men and women. Dancetime!  provides an entertaining look at the polka, the tango, the charleston,  the jitterbug, the mambo, the mashed potato, the moonwalk--and  many more popular dances that have stood the test of time. Artistic  director Carol Teten has choreographed an evening that the New York  Times called "a spring romp of a show!" Now on its third national  tour, Dancetime! is a delightful blend of dance, theater, and comedy.

Dancetime! will be presented February 4, 1995, in the Cabrillo  College Theater as a special benefit performance for the Leadership  Opportunity Awards program at the University of California, Santa  Cruz. The event is the first annual fund-raiser for the LOA program,  which enables students from thirteen regional community colleges  to complete their undergraduate educations at UCSC by providing  each student with a $20,000 scholarship over two years. Each year,  up to thirteen recipients are selected from a pool of applicants who  have shown exceptional achievement despite adverse socioeconomic  conditions, have demonstrated their commitment to community  service, and would otherwise not be able to attend UCSC because of  financial need.

Tickets for Dancetime! go on sale November 23 at the UCSC  Ticket Office. Patron tickets, which include premium seats, a listing  in the program, refreshments, and reserved parking, are $75 each.  General tickets provide reserved seating and refreshments and are  $35 each. The Ticket Office is open Tuesday through Friday from  noon to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tickets are also  available by phone; call (408) 459-2159 during business hours. A $2  handling fee is applied to phone orders.

"I was absolutely enthralled by the show," says Anne Levin, co- chair of the LOA Advisory Committee, which is coordinating the  fund-raiser. "It was one of the most entertaining and educational  presentations I've ever seen. The costumes are sensational, and the  dancers are outstanding. I was sad when it ended."

The first act of Dancetime! showcases authentic historical  dances from the fifteenth century through the late nineteenth  century. The second act presents a lively decade-by-decade tour of  this century's greatest dances, concluding with dirty dancing, vogue,  hip-hop, and country western. The fast-paced show features  elaborate costumes and wigs, and the eight dancers have perfected  the art of the quick costume change.

Social dance styles reflect changes in society, says artistic  director Teten. "Prior to the nineteenth century, couples danced at a  distance, barely touching hands," she says. "In the nineteenth  century, when couples started dancing arm in arm, it was considered  lewd and in poor taste. But the waltz position came in with  romanticism, and it allowed the man to hold his dream in his arms,  literally.

"In my lifetime, we've seen dance change from the 1950s, when  couples danced together with the woman following the man, to the  1960s and the twist, which became popular with the women's  liberation movement," adds Teten. "We went from duet dancing to  everybody doing their own thing. Social dance is an obvious mirror  for what is happening in society."

Dancetime! is presented by Dance Through Time, a nonprofit  cultural organization based in San Francisco. Incorporated in 1980,  its mission is to research, preserve, and perform historical and  contemporary social dances that are an important part of the  American heritage.

"This show touches so many people because all of us have  danced on the dance floor, whether at a wedding, a bar mitzvah, or a  prom," says Sheila Baumgarten, a longtime supporter of the arts in  Santa Cruz and former manager of Dance Through Time. "This show  taps those memories, and it also shows the artistic value of social  dance. You really see that there's art in social dance."

Dancetime! has been performed in more than 100 cities across  the United States.
