Mathematician **Jie Qing** has received a 1999 Sloan Research Fellowship in mathematics from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The award provides an unrestricted grant of $35,000. Qing, an assistant professor of mathematics, is one of 100 young scientists and economists awarded the prestigious fellowships this year.

Qing's interests are in nonlinear analysis, harmonic analysis, and partial differential equations, with applications to differential geometry, complex geometry, and mathematical physics.

The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation has awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to **Michael Riordan,** a research physicist with the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics. The fellowship, which provides a grant of $33,000, will support Riordan's contributions to a collaborative history of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) project.

The SSC was a high-energy physics project initiated in 1983 and terminated by Congress ten years later after almost $2 billion had been spent on construction. Since 1994, Riordan has been working with a group of historians and physicists to research and write a scholarly history of the SCC. Their work has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy.

The Columbia Scholastic Press Association honored two of UCSC's student newspapers last month at the association's annual College Media Convention. The two newspapers, **_City on a Hill Press_** (CHP) and **_Fish Rap Live!_** won nine awards in the 16th annual Gold Circle Awards competition.

CHP received first-place awards in black-and-white illustration (staff) and two-page photo layout (**Sage Bercloff**); a third-place award for comic cartoons (**Chris Huff**); and certificates of merit for editorial writing (**Rafi Frankel**), in-depth news features (**Rachel Showstack**), and black-and-white illustration (**Yoly Stroeve**). Bercloff also received a certificate of merit for a second two-page photo layout.

**Andrew Lukkonen,** former illustrator for _Fish Rap Live!,_ received a first-place award for art/illustration portfolio and a certificate of merit for editorial cartooning.

The Gold Circle Awards competition is sponsored by the Columbia School of Journalism and is the largest and most respected awards competition nationwide for student print media. This year's competition attracted 10,217 entries from colleges, universities, and senior high schools throughout the United States. There were 1,025 awards given out this year.
