title: Donations To UC Hit Record For Third Consecutive Year

For the third consecutive year, the University of California raised a record amount in contributions from alumni and friends, receiving $726.3 million in 1996-97, a $5 million increase from the previous year.

The achievement continues the nine-campus UC system's distinction as the leader in philanthropy among the nation's colleges and universities. Based on the Council for Aid to Education's 1996 survey on voluntary support (the most recent for which figures are available), the UC system would be ranked second nationally in private support, following the Salvation Army and ahead of the American Red Cross.

"The University of California would not be as successful as it is today in serving the needs of students and our society without the continuing strong support of our many donors," said Meredith J. Khachigian, chairman of the UC Board of Regents. "The Regents are extremely grateful for this support and appreciative of the many volunteers, friends, and UC staff members whose efforts have led to another exceptional year of private giving."

UC President Richard C. Atkinson said, "This incredible outpouring of support from institutions and individuals alike is testimony to the high regard in which the university is held. The only adequate way to express our appreciation for the generosity, loyalty, and public-spiritedness of our alumni and friends is to redouble our efforts to see that UC remains one of the great universities of the world."

Atkinson, however, stressed that UC's fund-raising results don't diminish the need for continued state and federal support, which is the core of the university's budget.

Private support represents just 3.6 percent of UC's operating budget, noted Bruce B. Darling, UC vice president for university and external relations. "It is, however, a crucial component of the public-private partnership that has helped the University of California attain excellence," he said. "The past year represents a consolidation of the dramatic growth in private funding that occurred in the prior year. Our continuing success is a tribute to the generosity of our donors and the dedication of our campus volunteers."

Private support to UC has grown dramatically over the past decade, more than doubling from about $300 million in 1987-88, Darling said. Cumulatively, the university has received more than $4.8 billion during that 10-year period, he said.

Of the $726.3 million contributed to UC in 1996-97, UC Berkeley received $182.4 million; UC Davis, $44.1 million; UC Irvine, $30.2 million; UCLA, $231.8 million; UC Riverside, $27.4 million; UC San Diego, $58.1 million; UC San Francisco, $116.3 million; UC Santa Barbara, $17.6 million; UC Santa Cruz, $13.5 million; and systemwide programs, $4.8 million.

Sources of gifts to the university in 1996-97 included nonalumni individuals, $196.7 million or 27 percent of the total, followed by foundations, $184.5 million or 25 percent; alumni, $153.5 million or 21 percent; corporations, $132.1 million or 18 percent; other sources (including nonprofit organizations, religious groups, and higher educational institutions or associations), $50.7 million or 7 percent; and campus-related organizations, $8.7 million or 1 percent.

Donors designated departmental support and research for 60 percent of the contributions in 1996-97 (totaling $450 million), followed by campus improvement ($100 million, or 13.8 percent); student support ($70.7 million, or 9.7 percent); other purposes ($43.3 million, or 5.9 percent); unrestricted ($31.3 million, or 4.3 percent); instruction ($27 million, or 3.7 percent); and departmental support/agriculture ($4 million, or 0.6 percent).
