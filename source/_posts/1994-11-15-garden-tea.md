SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Friends of the UCSC Farm and Garden will host  their annual holiday tea and gift sale on Sunday, December 4, from 1  to 4 p.m. at the ID Building on the Pacific Garden Mall in downtown  Santa Cruz.

The event will feature an array of Farm and Garden  merchandise, as well as complimentary refreshments, including pie,  cookies, tea, and coffee. Dried wreaths, flavored vinegars, canvas  tote bags, T-shirts, coffee mugs, sweatshirts, pencils, and greeting  cards are among the merchandise that will be available for purchase.

In addition to conventional dried-flower wreaths, the  selection this year will include herbal wreaths, wreaths of fresh  greens, and unusual wreaths featuring grasses, seed pods, and other  wild materials.

Sales benefit the Farm and Garden at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, which is the home of the Center for  Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. The holiday party is one  of the three biggest fund-raising events sponsored by the group each  year, says Friends president Jody Stix Garsia. Proceeds help support  the program's Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, as well as  other educational and outreach activities.
