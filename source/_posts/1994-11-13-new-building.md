**Building Forms The Heart Of Burgeoning Research Programs That Focus On Geosciences, The Marine Realm, And The Environment**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A gleaming new building has joined the growing  complex of facilities upon "Science Hill" at UC Santa Cruz: the $29.5  million Earth and Marine Sciences Building, dedicated November 12  in private ceremonies on campus.

Located just below Natural Sciences 2 and above McHenry  Library, the building contains offices and laboratories for about 175  faculty, researchers, and graduate students in the departments of  earth sciences, marine sciences, the Institute of Tectonics, and the  Institute of Marine Sciences. The latter institute, the largest  organized research unit at UCSC, oversees the Joseph M. Long Marine  Laboratory and includes numerous affiliated biologists.

Residents of the building garnered about $9.2 million in  external research grants last year, 28 percent of the campus total.  Their fields of study represent a growing focus for the Monterey Bay  Area. Indeed, the building anchors the northern end of a web of  scientific institutions around the bay, where collaborative research  has blossomed in recent years.

"The completion of this building has been the most singular  event in the history of these programs, a once-in-a-lifetime  opportunity," says associate vice chancellor for research James Gill,  a professor of earth sciences. "The faculty got to design their own  labs, but more than that, it created momentum and visibility and the  opportunity to grow, to add faculty and equipment. We maintained  optimism and forward thinking, which is anomalous on a campus that  is downsizing."

Previously, it often was necessary for students and staff to go  elsewhere to use specialized equipment, says Gill. Now, however,  with new labs and state-of-the-art equipment to fill them, the  departments are better equipped in several research areas than all  but a few universities in the world.

The building also houses a 270-seat lecture hall, two 50-seat  classrooms, the Microscopy and Imaging Laboratory, five spacious  teaching labs, and the Norman and Gertrude Pendleton mineral  collection--displayed in a small museum open to the public. With  84,000 assignable square feet, the building has opened up  significant amounts of laboratory and office space for expansion in  other facilities, most notably Applied Sciences.

The building is designed to enhance interactions among its  occupants, says professor of marine sciences Kenneth Bruland. A  distinctive feature is the conspicuous separation of the two wings  of faculty offices and the two large laboratory blocks. One result of  this design, Bruland says, is that faculty share information in the  hallways near their offices and collaborate with researchers from  other departments in neighboring labs.

Gary Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences, had  to balance many concerns as chair of the building committee during  five years of planning and construction. "We had to make sure the  space fit the special needs of faculty members, but also was generic  enough that other researchers could move in as faculty left or  retired," he says. "My sense is the laboratory and office  arrangements are working out. Everyone is excited and happy about  the building."

While the customized labs are delighting researchers, the  teaching facilities, together with new equipment, have improved  undergraduate education as well. Gone are the days of the old  teaching labs that housed many types of classes, which limited the  range of each class. In the new building, each lab is devoted to one  activity, such as student microscope work or identification of  geologic samples.

Dedication ceremonies were open to the campus community and  alumni but not to the general public, because of limited space. In the  formal ceremony, speakers included Chancellor Karl Pister and Mike  Field, chief of the Branch of Pacific Marine Geology of the U.S.  Geological Survey. Following the dedication, guests received tours of  the building and heard updates on the research programs it houses.

Earlier in the day, members of the Institute of Tectonics  recognized the W. M. Keck Foundation by unveiling plaques for two  lab facilities: the W. M. Keck Seismological Laboratory and the W. M.  Keck High-Intensity X-Ray Facility. The names honor nearly $1  million in grants from the Keck Foundation to the Institute of  Tectonics since 1986.

Among the many contributors to the realization of the Earth  and Marine Sciences Building were former deans of natural sciences  William Doyle and Frank Drake; faculty members John Pearse, Lynda  Goff, and Leo Ortiz (biology), Karen McNally, Gary Griggs, and Jim  Gill (earth sciences), and Ken Bruland (marine sciences); Patricia  Ponzini, operations analyst for natural sciences; Fran Owens of  Planning and Budget; and specialists Dan Sampson of earth sciences  and Rob Franks of marine sciences.
