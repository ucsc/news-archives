## UC Santa Cruz Plant Sale Will Help Your Garden  Bloom

SANTA CRUZ, CA--If El Nino showers bring spring and summer  flowers, then this should be a banner year for gardeners. Help your  garden bloom with selections from the annual UC Santa Cruz Farm & Garden plant sale on Saturday and Sunday, May 2-3. Hours are 10 a.m.  to 2 p.m. each day in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of  Bay and High Streets at the base of campus.

The plant sale features a wide selection of organically raised  plants, including more than 400 types of vegetables, flowers, landscape  plants, gourds, ornamental grasses, California natives, and both  culinary and medicinal herbs. All plants grow well in the local area.

Perennials are a feature of this year's sale. Many of these long- lived plants not only bring color and fragrance to the garden, they also  attract hummingbirds, butterflies, bees, and the beneficial insects that  help control pests. Among the popular perennials available will be  butterfly weed, angelica, honeysuckle, yarrow, St. Catherine's lace, and  a wide variety of salvias and penstemons.

An expanded selection of medicinal herbs will also be on hand,  including echinacea, feverfew, St. John's wort, Chinese wolfberry,  chaste tree, skullcap, huang-quin, and valerian. Culinary herbs will  include cilantro, lemon grass, French tarragon, rosemary, and several  varieties of basil, mint, sage, thyme, and oregano.

This year's vegetable collection includes six-packs of salad mix,  lettuces, sweet and hot peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, and a large  selection of slicing, heirloom, cherry, and paste tomatoes, including  early girl, enchantment, Camp Joy cherry, French dona, brandywine,  old flame, peacevine, and San Remo.

The flower selection will include six varieties of sunflowers, as  well as lavenders, zinnias, columbine, roses, and cosmos.

Sponsored by the Friends of the Farm & Garden and the Center  for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, the sale will benefit the  UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture. Members of the  Friends will receive a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships  will be available at the sale. For more information, call (408) 459-3248  or 459-3240.
