## Seventeen Documentary Films From New York's Margaret Mead Film Festival In Santa Cruz

SANTA CRUZ, CA--If you loved the movie Buena Vista Social Club, mark your calendar for October 15, when local audiences will have a chance to enjoy the poignant film Black Tears, a musical portrait of the octogenarian Cuban quintet La Vieja Trova Santiaguera (The Old Troubadours). The 75-minute film by Dutch director Sonia Herman Dolz captures the group performing to sellout crowds during a six-month European tour and features moving interviews with the musicians as they reminisce about the music, dance, and love that has inspired them throughout the years. Beautifully shot, the film also documents one-of-a- kind musical moments.

Black Tears will be screened as part of the first-ever Santa Cruz Margaret Mead Traveling Film & Video Festival, which will be held October 13-24 at Louden Nelson Community Center and at the Theater Arts Center at UC Santa Cruz. The festival is being presented by the UCSC Anthropology Department, the Santa Cruz City Museum of Natural History, and the American Museum of Natural History.

The festival offers 17 of the most outstanding entries from the prestigious Margaret Mead Film & Video Festival, which is presented annually in New York by the American Museum of Natural History. This year's inaugural Santa Cruz festival will include films from Taiwan, Cuba, Poland, Russia, Australia, Lithuania, Congo, Belgium, Canada, and the United States. The documentary films cover topics as diverse as taxidermy, abortion, menstruation, the transformation of traditional Aborigine dreaming stories into animated films, and the razing of a rural village in Taiwan to make way for a major highway. The schedule also includes the Santa Cruz premiere of Pepino Mango Nance, a film by UCSC graduate student Gillian Goslinga that tells the story of a young Chicano composer.

The films are offered in six programs that revolve around the themes of relocation, border crossing, resistance, loneliness, women and taboo, and Australian indigenous media.

The Margaret Mead Film & Video Festival in New York is the largest showcase for international documentaries in the United States. Founded in 1977, the festival honors pioneering anthropologist Margaret Mead, who was one of the first anthropologists to recognize the significance of film for fieldwork. Screenings during the first three days of the festival, October 13-15, will take place at the Louden Nelson Community Center (LNCC) at 301 Center Street in Santa Cruz. The second half of the festival, October 22-24, will take place in the Media Theater (MT) at the Theater Arts Center at UCSC. To get to the theater, take the UCSC West Entrance off Empire Grade at Heller Drive. After the fourth stop sign, turn right onto Meyer Drive; free parking is available in the Performing Arts parking lot.

Tickets will be available in advance at the Civic Auditorium at 307 Church Street, the UCSC Ticket Office in the Performing Arts Center, and the Santa Cruz City Museum of Natural History at 1305 East Cliff Drive. Admission is $2.50. Please note: The presenters advise discretion in bringing children under age 12 to the screenings.

* The Bathhouse (Pirtis) (Lithuania) Rimantas Gruodis. 1997\. 10 min.

On alternate days of the week, elderly men and women take refuge in the oldest and last active public bathhouse in Vilnius. In its timeless space, the visitors' musings about the hardships of daily life and an uncertain future are tempered with birch branches and the ritual bath.

* Skin's Sorrow (Peaux de Chagrin) (Belgium) Richard Olivier. 1997. 57 min.

Taxidermy has often been associated with traditional museum display; it is also a means to immortalize a beloved pet. This offbeat and poignant film is an exploration of loneliness, loss, and love.

* Bread Day (Russia) Sergei Dvortsevoy. 1998. 55 min.

Long takes and stunning cinematography strike a fragile balance between melancholy and humor. Outside St. Petersburg, Russia, in a forgotten, almost abandoned settlement, a dwindling community of pensioners barely manages to eke out an existence.

In rural Poland in the 1960s a journalist, photographer, and film crew visited the village outcast : a young, single, woman farmer with a penchant for literature. Twenty-three years later, the same film crew makes a return visit. The film also presents a critique of the documentary and journalistic endeavor itself.

* Mother of the Tribe (Taiwan) Chen Jung-Hsien. 1998. 25 min.

In 1995, Chi Ah Niang became the first female chieftain to be elected by the Ah-mei people. She faces the daunting task of convincing the conservative elders that the hurricane that destroyed last year's annual harvest had nothing to do with her being a woman.

* Moon Children (Taiwan) Wu Yii-Feng. 1990. 63 min.

Ju Seng-ho was fired because he looked like a "ghost." In Taiwan, albinoism often means being ostracized from mainstream society. This keenly sensitive film breaks down commonplace prejudices about albinos and looks at the Taiwanese albino community's efforts to improve its rights and provide a much needed support network by founding the National Albino Association. This work stands as a social and cinematic landmark in Taiwan's communal media efforts.

* Cracks in the Mask (Torres Strait Islands) Frances Calvert. 1997. 47 min.

* Milerum: Whose Story? (Australia) Robert Crompton. 1997\. 30 min.

One of the legendary figures of modern African history, he has been described both as a prophet and as the "Elvis Presley of African politics." Using archival films, interviews with Belgian journalists and Lumumba's family members, and his own home movies taken during his childhood in Zaire, Peck masterfully blends the personal and the political to question the process of documentary filmmaking and the relationship between private recollection and public history.

* Spudwrench-Kahnawake Man (Canada) Alanis Obomsawin. 1997\. 58 min.

The Mohawk "high steel" workers are legendary for their part in building New York City. This film celebrates these men and the loved ones they were forced to leave at home, their ties to the reservation community, and how that bond was tested during the 1990 territorial dispute between the Mohawk community and the Canadian government.

* Dear Dr. Spencer: Abortion in a Small Town (U.S.) Danielle Renfrew, Beth Seltzer. 1997. 25 min.

Remarkably, the community "looked the other way," and didn't interfere despite his defiance of the law.
