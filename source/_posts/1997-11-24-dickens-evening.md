![Robert Fenwick And Gene Lewis Of The Dickens Players, At Last Year's Event][2]

Join the Friends of the UCSC Library for the annual Dickens Holiday Evening at 4 p.m. on Friday, December 12, in the McHenry Library foyer. The gathering features music, food, and holiday items for sale. It is free, open to the public, and children are welcome.

Highlights of the event include a performance by the Dickens Players who will re-create scenes from Dickens's works and lead a sing-along of holiday favorites. The Friends will also present a Dickens-related gift to the University Library. This year's gift is "The People's History"--a microfilm collection of 19th-century writings of Britain's working class from the British Library, London. The annual gift supports the work done by the Dickens Project, an international consortium of Dickens scholars headquartered at UCSC, and is housed in the University Library where it is available for public use.

Guests at the event will be treated to a delicious array of Victorian holiday treats. A holiday gift shop will feature greeting cards, T-shirts, book bags, and aprons. The event is sponsored by the Dickens Project and the Friends of the UCSC Library.

This year's event will be preceded by a special ceremony honoring generous contributors to the library's permanent endowment funds. The ceremony takes place at 3:30 p.m. in the foyer. For more information, call (408) 459-5870.
