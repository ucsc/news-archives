The annual roundup of the "Top 100 science stories of the year" by _Discover_ featured two UCSC researchers who garnered beaucoup media attention in 1996. Astrophysicist **Doug Lin** reviewed his latest models for how planets form in other solar systems, while biologist **Bill Rice** recounted his now-famous experiment documenting "sexually antagonistic coevolution" between male and female fruit flies.

"Is Nothing Sacred?," queried a recent article in _Lingua Franca._ The story examined differing views on academic approaches to religious studies. Some of the country's most prominent religious studies scholars were quoted, including history of consciousness professor **Gary Lease.** Also featured was retired religion professor **Noel King.**

Astronomer **Frank Drake,** president of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute, was widely quoted in December regarding the death of his close friend and colleague, Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan.

In the _Los Angeles Times,_ **Manuel Pastor** of Latin American and Latino studies argued in favor of the "living wage" ordinance before the Los Angeles City Council. Pastor, a member of the _Times_ Board of Advisers, also penned an "Insight" piece about economic-growth strategies, asserting that economic-development efforts in the Los Angeles area must target the poor as well as the region as a whole. "The poor cannot long be forgotten . . . because their participation is key to a full-fledged and balanced recovery," wrote Pastor.

A tale of two cities: She may teach French, but **Angela Elsea** got the attention of the media for portraying an English character--a Victorian dancer to be specific. Elsea and others were featured in a front-page picture in the _Oakland Tribune_ performing during a living history re-creation of Victorian England.

That California sea lion making a splash in the news before Christmas was our own **Beaver,** now in training to film whales underwater. O'Neill fashioned a wet suit especially for the sleek animal, allowing him to carry a video camera far beneath the surface. Head trainer **Jenifer Hurley,** a UCSC Ph.D. recipient now at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, helped Beaver model his duds for the press at Long Marine Lab.

**Kathy "Kat" Albrecht** of the UCSC Police was quoted in the _Hayward Review_ about her work training bloodhounds for search-and-rescue work. Albrecht called the dogs "stinky, slobbery, (and) not very impressive," but went on to describe their work in urban criminal cases as well as remote forested areas.

Economist **John Isbister** appeared on the Ronn Owens Show on KGO Radio last week (Jan. 7) to discuss his recent book _The Immigration Debate._
