**Aim Of Three-Day Gathering Is To Consolidate Nationwide Program**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Over the past decade a growing number of colleges  and universities have adopted a new approach to teaching foreign  languages. Called "Foreign Languages Across the Curriculum" (FLAC),  the method encourages students to apply their foreign language  skills to the study of a variety of other subjects. FLAC operates  under the principle that the language isn't an end in itself, but part  of a richer exploration of various subjects relevant to the student's  overall studies.

At an October 26-29 conference, roughly 60 representatives  from twelve colleges and universities considered leaders in the use  of FLAC will gather in Washington, D.C. Their goal is to consolidate  their individual efforts into a coordinated national program, as well  as to strengthen the use of FLAC at their own institutions. The  conference, titled "Next Steps," is part of an eighteen-month project  supported by a $235,000 grant from the National Endowment for the  Humanities (NEH). The grant is administered by the American Council  on Education (ACE) in Washington, D.C., which will host the  conference. (A list of the twelve participating institutions and a  conference schedule is below.)

"This is the first chance for consortium members to meet  face-to-face," said Miriam Ellis, a lecturer in French and head of the  FLAC program at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "We've all  been doing exciting things on our own, and we've been communicating  by e-mail. Now we want to come together to address common  interests and concerns and establish a national organization."

UC Santa Cruz and a number of other schools have been  teaching courses using a FLAC model since the early 1970s. The use  of FLAC was strengthened in succeeding years, in part through grant  support from such agencies as the NEH, the Fund for the Improvement  of Postsecondary Education, and the U.S. Department of Education's  International Education program. In 1993, roughly twenty schools  offered courses using a FLAC model.

"The concept is catching fire and there are a number of  excellent programs being taught across the country," said Ellis. She  believes more institutions are taking an interest in FLAC because  the necessity for international communication is growing. "As we  become increasingly plugged into the global market, those with  bilingual abilities are finding they have greater career  opportunities. Understanding only one language is a clear handicap."

"FLAC encourages a multilayered approach to learning and  enables bilingual students to take advantage of the latest  technologies in a way that monolingual students can't," she added.  "For example, a student studying present-day Russian politics can  find the most up-to-date news by tapping into the Information  Superhighway and reading the news in Russian. Such research also  gives students a better understanding of a culture from the point of  view of the people who belong to that culture."

**Models of FLAC**

FLAC courses are generally directed at upper-division students  (juniors and seniors) who have gained language proficiency during  their first two years of college through traditional language- focused courses or through study abroad. Various approaches have  been developed nationally, among which are the following:
* The Augmented Curriculum Model: The course is taught  entirely in the foreign language, with all reading and writing  materials and discussion presented in the foreign language. This is  the model used most frequently at UC Santa Cruz.
* The Intersecting Model: A course is offered in English with  reading and discussion sections presented in the designated foreign  language. This is the model used most commonly nationwide.
* The Non-Intersecting Model: Similar material is taught in  two compatible courses--one in English and one in the designated  language. (For example, in 1994 UC Santa Cruz offered an English- language art history course on Versailles in tandem with a French- language course on Louis XIV and his court.)

*The Professional School Model: Some schools offer double  majors or graduate programs that combine professional and language  training, generally in the fields of business and engineering. (For  example, the University of Connecticut and the University of Rhode  Island both offer an undergraduate degree that combines engineering  and German and includes an internship with a German firm.)

**FLAC at UC Santa Cruz**

UC Santa Cruz has been cited by outside observers and in an  academic journal as a leader in the use of FLAC under the Augmented  Curriculum Model.

From winter 1993 to spring 1995, the university offered 22  FLAC courses with the support of two grants totaling $252,000 from  the NEH. The two NEH-supported programs offered a diverse  selection, including courses in Chinese drama, German history,  Russian politics, Spanish film, French sociology, and Italian  linguistics. Ellis is currently working to secure $30,000 in matching  funds to continue offering FLAC courses through the spring of 1997.

In a January 1995 letter to Ellis, Frank Ryan, director of the  Center for Language Studies at Brown University, called UC Santa  Cruz's program notable because, "your [NEH-funded programs] are  two of the richest and most well-developed projects I have seen in  my visits to campuses across the country that are also working with  this new concept. . . . As far as I know, you have the greatest number  of language-and-other-discipline connected courses at a serious  level of intensity of any campus that I know."

"Our approach at UC Santa Cruz," Ellis explained, "is to  consider language a tool, not an end. The majority of our classes are  taught entirely in the foreign language or have a large portion of the  curriculum taught in the foreign language." Ellis said UC Santa Cruz's  program is outstanding for three reasons: "The extent of our course  offerings, the depth of language use, and the quality of the faculty  teaching the courses."
