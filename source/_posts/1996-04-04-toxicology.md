**Program Attracts The Support Of Industry, Including A $25,000  Challenge Grant From Glaxo Wellcome**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Finding and testing safe and effective new drugs,  pesticides, and other useful chemicals is a tricky business.  Designing them from scratch is even harder. In the face of ongoing  battles against deadly viruses, cancer, agricultural pests, and a  legion of threats to our environment, the demand has never been  greater for skilled scientists who can evaluate new compounds and  help bring them to market.

That's why the University of California, Santa Cruz, has  created a program in pharmacology and toxicology for undergraduate  students. A formal sequence of lectures for juniors and seniors, the  program will give students the tools they need to compete  successfully for jobs in the burgeoning pharmaceutical and  toxicological industries.

The program is a "pathway," or concentration, within a  rigorous undergraduate major in biochemistry and molecular biology.  Ultimately, planners hope to add a concurrent series of laboratory  classes and to make the pathway (known as "PTox") a full-fledged  major leading to a bachelor's degree.

"Our students have been really motivated and excited by this  subject matter, because it's so applicable to their everyday lives,"  says program codirector Ronald Tjeerdema, associate professor of  chemistry and biochemistry. "This isn't just theoretical chemistry,  this is real stuff--drugs and their effects on our bodies, chemicals  and their effects on the environment. It's material the students can  take away and use every day."

Tjeerdema and codirector Dr. Morris Barenfus, the campus  veterinarian, have consulted with leaders in pharmaceutical and  biotechnology industries on the program's development. Members of  an advisory board include Bradford Baer of BioDirections, Menlo  Park; Gary Novack of Pharma Logic, Irvine; Gordon Ringold of  Affymax Research Institute, Palo Alto; and John Stephenson of Santa  Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz.

The program has received donations or commitments of funding  from several corporations. The most recent gift was a $25,000  challenge grant from Glaxo Wellcome, a British company with a U.S.  division based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Glaxo  Wellcome will donate an additional $25,000 to the program if UCSC  can raise that amount from other sources. The gift is Glaxo  Wellcome's first public donation in California.

"There is a tremendous shortage of students who receive  hands-on training in the classical laboratory techniques of  pharmacology and toxicology," says UCSC alumnus Gordon Ringold,  the CEO of Affymax, a wholly owned subsidiary of Glaxo Wellcome.  "Graduates of this new program will bring valuable experience to the  broad biotechnology and pharmaceutical community in the Bay Area."

Other notable support for the program has come from the  following industries: Genentech of South San Francisco, several  gifts totaling $57,000; Syntex of Palo Alto, a $5,000 donation; and  Applied Immune Sciences of Santa Clara, which has donated the time  of researchers as guest lecturers at UCSC.

The PTox lecture sequence began in spring 1995 and has  continued through this academic year. Future plans call for the  addition of lab classes and summer internships at industries in the  region for students between their junior and senior years.

The courses focus on how certain chemicals react with  biological systems and with the environment. Students learn about  the structures of drugs and the details of how they interact with  receptor molecules in the body. Future lab classes and internships  will focus on the many steps involved in taking a drug or other  bioactive chemical from discovery to public use. Students will gain  a working knowledge of all the basic benchtop tools they would  encounter in industry. Instructors will convey the broader issues  that govern how workers use those tools, such as legal and ethical  concerns and the standards of "good laboratory practice."

Other undergraduate programs exist in the separate fields of  pharmacology and toxicology. For instance, there is a pharmacology  major at UC Santa Barbara and a toxicology major at UC Davis. As far  as organizers are aware, however, the PTox program at UCSC would  become the only undergraduate major to combine both fields.
