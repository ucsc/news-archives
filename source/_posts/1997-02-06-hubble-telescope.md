SANTA CRUZ, CA--Next week's mission to upgrade the Hubble Space  Telescope has a distinctly blue-and-gold flair: UC Santa Cruz  alumnus Steven Hawley will be one of seven astronauts aboard the  space shuttle Discovery, while professor of astronomy and  astrophysics Harland Epps helped design one of the telescope's  sophisticated new instruments.

Discovery is scheduled to lift off for mission STS-82 from  Cape Canaveral, FL, in the predawn hours of Tuesday, February 11.  During four space walks, astronauts will replace two of Hubble's  observing instruments and upgrade its sensors and electronics.

Hawley, age 45, will fly on his fourth shuttle mission and his  first since April 1990, when he and fellow UCSC graduate Kathryn  Sullivan deployed the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit. Hawley will  stay inside Discovery to operate the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm,  which plucks the telescope from orbit and provides an operating  platform for the astronauts as they work outside the shuttle.

Hawley earned his Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics from  UCSC in 1977. He flew aboard Discovery in 1984 and 1990 and on  Columbia in 1986. STS-82 marks a return for Hawley to NASA's  active corps of astronauts, from which he "retired" in 1990 to  become associate director of the NASA Ames Research Center in  Mountain View. From 1992 to 1996, Hawley served as deputy  director of flight crew operations at the Johnson Space Center in  Houston.

Epps is one of 18 astronomers on the science team for the Near  Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), a  powerful new observing tool that promises unprecedented views of  the universe. Sensitive to infrared ("heat") radiation rather than  visible light, NICMOS will search for newborn solar systems around  relatively nearby stars, peer into the dust-shrouded cores of  galaxies, and look back in time to the primeval stages of galaxy  formation in the cosmos. As its name implies, its optics will allow  researchers to examine several objects at once.

Epps joined the NICMOS team in 1985 at the behest of its lead  investigator, astronomer Rodger Thompson of the University of  Arizona. Epps became one of the principal optical designers for the  instrument, devising lenses, mirrors, gratings, and other components  that would fit within the tight confines of Hubble's instrument bay.

As a reward for their work on NICMOS, Epps and his colleagues  will receive substantial observing time with the instrument. Epps  plans to study the inner regions of active galaxies known as "Seyfert  galaxies" with his postdoctoral researcher, Nadine Dinshaw, and  with future graduate students. He will receive nearly $1 million  from NASA during the next five years to support his NICMOS research  program.

"Our team is extremely excited that after more than a decade  of work, the instrument will finally be launched and will begin to  produce scientific results," Epps says. "We've designed NICMOS to  take advantage of Hubble's precise optics and to provide us with  views of the universe that we cannot obtain from the ground."

Epps specializes in designing high-performance optical  systems for the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory, UC Santa Cruz,  and for other facilities around the world. He joined the UCSC faculty  in 1989 after 24 years on the astronomy faculty at UCLA.
