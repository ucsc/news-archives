## UC Santa Cruz Shares Expertise With Local Schools

### Flirting Or Hurting? UCSCs Sexual Harassment Officer Takes Her Interactive Workshop On The Road

SANTA CRUZ, CA--At the invitation of local principals, UCSC's Title  IX/Sexual Harassment Officer, Rita E. Walker, will spend the next  several weeks presenting workshops on sexual harassment at junior  high and middle schools in Santa Cruz County. (See detailed schedule  information on next page.)

Walker will be assisted by three undergraduate peer educators:  Oakes College student Faye Flores and Porter College students Maria  Hollowell-Fuentes and Sabin Ousey. This project is part of a  countywide effort to make schools more safe for all students.

"Research shows that by the time students reach eighth grade,  65 percent of girls and 55 percent of boys have had at least one  experience with sexual harassment," said Walker. "There is a real  need to share this information with students at the middle school  and junior high level."

Walker and her assistants will present a 50-minute  interactive and theatrical workshop in individual classes at each  school. Walker surveyed local school principals to identify the most  prevalent types of unwelcome conduct and developed five skits that  demonstrate those behaviors. The interactive skits deal with name- calling, unwanted touching, rumors, rating body parts, and coercion.  The workshop will also include an interactive values clarification  exercise. Each student will receive a brochure, available in English  and Spanish, for future reference and to share with families.

Walker's presentations are a collaborative effort between the  university and the schools. Funds to support the undergraduate  assistants were provided by a grant for School Violence Reduction  awarded by the California Department of Education to the Santa Cruz  County Middle School Partnership, facilitated by the Santa Cruz  County Office of Education. The workshops are cosponsored by the  Monterey Bay Educational Consortium.
