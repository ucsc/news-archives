title: Student Affairs Reorganized To Streamline Processes, Increase Efficiency

In an effort to maximize efficiency and service, the Division of Student  Affairs was reorganized this summer. Among the changes are the  realignment of existing programs, the expansion of some areas, and the  creation of a few new positions.

"In the next century, student life at UCSC  will be influenced by factors  that include increased reliance on electronics, greater ethnic diversity, and a  growing emphasis on academic excellence," said Francisco Hernandez, vice  chancellor for student affairs. "We've restructured Student Affairs to respond  to these anticipated changes."

Some of the changes were designed to simplify the organizational  structure of the unit by "clustering" analogous programs, said Hernandez.

"The details are complicated, but when you see it on paper, the logic  behind the changes is quite apparent," said Hernandez. "These changes will  improve our own internal communication and decision making processes,  which will help us as we prepare to meet the challenges of increased outreach  efforts, enrollment growth, and more fund-raising. Our ultimate goal is  always to enhance the student experience at UCSC."

For example, the Outreach, Admissions, and Student Academic  Services area overseen by Associate Vice Chancellor J. Michael Thompson  will have two distinct branches: Academic Support Services and Enrollment  and Outreach Services. The former, under the leadership of executive  director of orientation and academic support services Allen Fields, will  include Campus Orientation Programs, the Disability Resource Center,  Educational Opportunity Programs, and Services for Transfer and Re-Entry  Students.

The Enrollment and Outreach Services side encompasses offices such  as Admissions, Financial Aid, and the Registrar. In addition, two new offices  have been created: the Communications and Systems Development Office  headed by Mark Cianca, and the Educational Partnerships Center directed by  Carrol Moran.

"All of those services belong in the same area because they're all  focused on attracting and retaining students," said Hernandez. "It just makes  sense."

Cianca's initiative was launched in anticipation of significant new  demands on computer-based services. "And UCSC is a clear leader and  innovator in the area of partnerships with K-12 schools," said Hernandez.  "There's more need than ever to bolster the campus's efforts in that area."

Gail Heit, who was named associate vice chancellor for student affairs,  will oversee the three areas of Health, Fitness, and Community  Development; Support Services, Student Development, and Community  Service; and Student Affairs Budget and Planning.

"We're placing greater importance on the areas of athletics and health  and fitness, which help attract students and also contribute to the mental  well-being of the entire campus," noted Hernandez.

Heit will be assisted by Dan Wood, executive director of Physical  Education, Recreation and Sports; Anita Diaz, executive director of  Community Development and Health Programs; and a new executive  director of Student Development and Community Service, a position that  will be recruited this fall. Under that director, the offices of Student Media  and Student Organization Advising and Resources have been separated to reflect  their independent needs, and a director of the Asian American/Pacific  Islander Resource Center will be hired, said Hernandez.

"We're continuing to support opportunities for student leadership,  and units that sponsor student-directed events have been realigned to  improve communication," said Hernandez. "We're anticipating expansion in  the Student Development cluster, and this structure will accommodate that  growth."

Some of Hernandez's responsibilities were redirected to allow him to  work on fund-raising efforts with Adrienne Harrell, who was named director  of development for student affairs and the colleges in June. He will oversee  administration of each of the colleges and an area dubbed Student Auxiliary  and Services Enterprises, which is made up of several self-supporting units,  including the Community Rentals Program and Child Care Services. Jerry  Walters has been named executive director of housing, dining, and child  care services.

"As the campus grows, our division will require more resources to  adequately serve students," said Hernandez. "We are trying to both maximize  our efficiency and expand our fund-raising base."
