SANTA CRUZ, CA--Public educators at Long Marine Lab are seeking  marine-science enthusiasts to enroll in an upcoming series of  training classes for docents. The ten-week course begins on Monday,  October 3.

Docents lead public tours of the lab, a marine-research  facility operated by UC Santa Cruz. The volunteer workers also teach  visiting schoolchildren and help with the aquarium and touch tanks.  Docents must be at least eighteen years old and must commit to  work at least six hours per month. Laboratory staff are looking  especially for people who can teach weekday-morning classes.

The training course runs for ten consecutive Monday evenings,  from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. Applicants should inquire soon, as space is  limited. For more information, call the lab's Education Office at  459-3854.
