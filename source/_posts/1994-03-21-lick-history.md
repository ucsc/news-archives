SANTA CRUZ, CA--For more than a century, astronomers have cast  their eyes on the sky through telescopes at Lick Observatory, which  overlooks San Jose from atop Mount Hamilton. For most of that time,  the observatory was an isolated University of California research  station. Only in 1966 did the observatory's headquarters find a more  down-to-earth home, at the new UC campus in Santa Cruz.

Donald E. Osterbrock, professor emeritus of astronomy and  astrophysics at UCSC and Lick Observatory's director from 1973 to  1981, will recount Lick's fascinating past in a free public lecture on  Wednesday, April 20. Titled "The Ancient History of UCSC: Lick  Observatory from 1888 to 1966 and Beyond," the talk begins at 8  p.m. in the Stevenson College Fireside Lounge at UCSC. The campus  chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the national academic honor society, will  sponsor the event.

Osterbrock will relate numerous anecdotes about the founding  of Lick and its distinguished contributions to astronomy. He will use  a wealth of historical slides to illustrate his remarks. A member of  both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of  Arts and Sciences, Osterbrock has written or coauthored several  books. They include "Eye on the Sky," a history of Lick Observatory,  and a biography of nineteenth-century Lick astronomer James Keeler.

A reception and refreshments will follow Osterbrock's talk.  For more information, call the UCSC Public Information Office at  (408) 459-2495.
