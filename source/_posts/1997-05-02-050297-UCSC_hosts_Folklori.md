SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California, Santa Cruz, is showcasing  folklorico dance in May, with a lecture and video demonstration by master  choreographer Rafael Zamarripa on May 16 and the Annual Spring Concert by  Grupo Folklorico Los Mejicas de UC Santa Cruz on May 30 and 31.

Folklorico dance is a highly choreographed dance style that displays the  diversity of Mexican culture. Typically, a performance consists of various  "cuadros" or suites, each of which is made up of music and dance that  represents a particular state, region, or historical period. Like classical  ballet, folklorico dances often tell stories, frequently of courtship.

Master dance teacher Rafael Zamarripa's Spanish-language lecture will  begin at 5 P.M. on May 16 in 105 Oakes College on the UCSC campus. The title  of his talk is "Nuevas Formas de Danza Folklorica," or New Forms of Folkloric  Dance. The event is free and open to the public.

Zamarripa, who founded the Grupo Folklorico de la Universidad de  Guadalajara, is credited with taking the tradition of folk ballet to new levels  of innovation and skill. He is currently a Tinker Visiting Professor in Latin  American Studies at Stanford University.

The performances on May 30 and 31 by Grupo Folklorico Los Mejicas de  UC Santa Cruz will take place on the Performing Arts Mainstage at UCSC. Both  performances begin at 7 P.M., and this year's events mark the group's 25th  anniversary. Tickets will be available after May 15 at the UCSC Ticket Office  at (408) 459-2159. Ticket prices are $10 for adults; $7 for non-UCSC  students; and $5 for UCSC students, senior citizens, and children under 12.

Folklorico dance became important in Mexico during the  postrevolutionary period as a way to display ethnic diversity. In the United  States, the folklorico phenomenon flourished during the late 1960s with the  rise of the Chicano movement as a medium through which Chicanos could  preserve, affirm, and promote their cultural identity, said Olga Najera- Ramirez, an associate professor of anthropology at UCSC who was a member  of Los Mejicas in 1974-79 and is now faculty adviser to the dance troupe, one  of the oldest student-directed organizations on campus.
