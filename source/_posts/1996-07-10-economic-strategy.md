SANTA CRUZ, CA--Planners of the University of California's  Monterey Bay Education, Science, and Technology (MBEST) Center at  the former Fort Ord military base gained valuable insights at the  Monterey Conference Center on Monday, July 8, about the promise and  progress of their project from more than 90 representatives of  businesses, industries, government agencies, and educational  institutions in the Monterey Bay Area and Silicon Valley.

Participants at the work session offered frank feedback about  how the Monterey Bay region could define itself to attract and grow  businesses that would benefit from the intellectual resources of its  universities and other research organizations. Attendees from  northern California and beyond affirmed that the region is positioned  to capitalize on existing assets necessary for information-based  businesses to replace the military's role in the regional economy.

Speakers cited the region's attributes, such as its high quality  of life and proximity to numerous topflight research institutions. To  enable research-oriented businesses to succeed in the region, many  noted, the UC MBEST initiative and regional stakeholders must work  together to create a distinctive image, stronger ties between  corporate and academic researchers, an environment friendly to  business, and better transportation, housing, and other  practicalities.

"We hope these meetings will create an ongoing relationship  between all of you and the MBEST Center," said director James Gill,  associate vice chancellor for research at UC Santa Cruz. "We have  held many meetings to talk about how the region can position itself  effectively. The difference today is that a large number of you from  business have joined us in this room. We need your continued  partnership to help the MBEST Center become a unique regional  asset."

The work session was the second of two meetings at which the  MBEST team solicited input from business leaders, prospective  tenants, and others with an interest in seeing the region flourish  economically. The first was held on June 17 in Menlo Park.

Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood of UCSC opened Monday's meeting  in her first public function since assuming her new post on July 1.  "We have a special opportunity to make the Monterey Bay crescent  one of the economically most vital and educationally most  interesting places to be in the country," Greenwood said. "We're  interested in finding out what we can build together that will make  all of you want to come to this region."

Sandi Pensinger, chair of the Santa Cruz Technology Alliance  and vice president of Diamond Process Applications in Capitola,  urged that the current effort not go the way of previous paper-only  studies of the region. "No concerted vision exists for the area, but  we have the chance to compose one," Pensinger said. "We need to  create a symphony from the cacophony that's going on now. We need  to have everyone singing from the same page."

The MBEST Center, led by UCSC, is a regional economic  initiative that includes development of a technology center on UC- owned property at the former Fort Ord. The U.S. Army conveyed about  1,090 acres of land to the university for the project. Plans call for  the development of a research and technology center during the next  several decades on about 485 acres. The remaining land has become  part of the UC Natural Reserve System, to be preserved as unique  maritime chaparral.

The UC Fort Ord Project team has identified four targeted  areas of activity for the center: environmental science, technology,  and instrumentation, especially coastal applications; biotechnology,  emphasizing agricultural and marine applications; information  science and technologies; and multimedia education and  entertainment.

Attendees at the work session represented dozens of regional  businesses, industries, and institutions with interests in at least  one of those fields. Partial lists are as follows:

Environmental sciences--Bechtel, the Environmental  Educational Alliance, ICF Kaiser, Habitat Restoration Group, Kinnetic  Laboratories, Pivot Point Conflict Resolution, Plantronics, SRI  International, Toxscan.

Biotechnology--Santa Cruz BioTechnology, Plant Biotics,  Harley Consulting Group.

Information sciences--National Semiconductor Corporation,  PG&E, Triton Technology.

Multimedia--Bay Area Multi-Media Partnership, Channel 0  Media Group (Odwalla), Lean Productions, SGI.

Also attending were representatives of Congressman Sam  Farr's office, Monterey Bay International Trade Association,  Monterey Institute of International Studies, CSU Monterey Bay,  Monterey Bay Aquarium, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute,  Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, Santa Cruz County Redevelopment  Agency, Santa Clara University, Lawrence Livermore National  Laboratory, UCSC Extension, Comerica Bank, Smith Barney, and the  cities of Marina, Monterey, and Salinas.

The work sessions were facilitated by Information Design  Associates (IDeA) and DRI/McGraw-Hill, leaders of a team of  consultants retained by the UC MBEST initiative to analyze the  region's competitive advantages. A complementary team of  consultants is working to develop a business plan for the MBEST  Center and a master plan for the site. Both teams will present their  reports to project managers at UCSC by the end of the summer.
