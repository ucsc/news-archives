SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Arboretum at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, will host its annual Spring Plant Sale from 10 a.m. to 4  p.m. on Saturday, April 20. The event is free and open to the public. It  will take place in the Arboretum's eucalyptus grove, near the  intersection of Empire Grade and Western Drive in Santa Cruz.

Visitors may choose from a variety of colorful and drought- resistant plants from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as  well as many California natives. Many of these unusual beauties  attract butterflies, hummingbirds, and beneficial insects. Arboretum  staff will distribute free pamphlets describing how to create unique  habitats in the garden to attract these winged visitors.

A special sale will be held for members of the Arboretum  Associates from 10 to 11 a.m. People wishing to join the Arboretum  Associates may purchase memberships at the sale.

Guests may also tour the Arboretum's extensive gardens and  visit the new carnivorous plant display. This exhibit mimics bogs of  the U.S. Gulf Coast, where insect-eating exotics like the Venus's- flytrap, pitcher plant, and sundew have adopted their strange diet to  make up for the nutrient-poor soil.

The Arboretum gift shop, Norrie's, will be open throughout the  day, selling books, paintings, sun-dried flower arrangements, and  other gifts for the garden lover. The gift shop also will hold tastings  of locally produced lavender and blackberry honeys.
