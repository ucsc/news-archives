title: Renowned Molecular Biologist To Give Public Lecture About His Scientific Road Less Traveled By

SANTA CRUZ, CA--As his life's work, Harry Noller figures out what  makes life work. Noller, a professor of biology at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, might not put it in such grandiose terms, of  course. Nevertheless, his research has helped explain one of  biology's biggest mysteries: the tiny ribosome.

Now everyone can be in on the secret. On Wednesday, April 19,  Noller will present the 29th annual Faculty Research Lecture, an  honor bestowed by the Santa Cruz Division of the Academic Senate  to recognize outstanding faculty achievements. Noller's talk,  entitled "Exploring Ribosomal RNA: The Heart of an Ancient Molecular  Machine," will begin at 8 p.m. in the Performing Arts Theater on the  UCSC campus.

Noller holds the endowed Robert Louis Sinsheimer Chair of  Molecular Biology and is director of the Center for the Molecular  Biology of RNA. He was elected to the prestigious National Academy  of Sciences in 1992. In nominating him to deliver this year's speech,  the UCSC Committee on the Faculty Research Lecture referred to  Noller's "preeminence in his discipline" and the broad applications of  his work.

"Professor Noller's accomplishments represent not simply  additional increments of knowledge to an already established field,  but rather take the field of research into entirely new directions,"  wrote committee members.

Noller had little thought for taking the field into new  directions when he joined the UCSC faculty in 1968. He and his  graduate students formed only one group among several then  studying ribosomes. They knew ribosomes were critical because  every life-form had them, from bacteria to blue whales. They also  knew that ribosomes were the factories of cells, turning the design  plans of genes into the stuff of life: proteins. But, like other  researchers, they believed that the proteins within the ribosome  powered its minuscule machinery. They gave little thought to the  other half of ribosome structure, the RNA. A first cousin to DNA,  RNA was typecast as a mere helper molecule. Biologists had never  seen it run a chemical reaction like the protein assembly in  ribosomes.

However, after peering at ribosomal proteins for four years,  Noller and his students were frustrated. Careful experiments had  repeatedly failed. Then they found the solution: Proteins don't drive  the ribosome, RNA does. "Once in a while, when things don't make  sense, it can be a signal that you've just discovered something," says  Noller. "That's what happened with the RNA."

When they made this discovery, back in 1972, other  researchers in the field didn't believe it. All continued to see  ribosomal RNA as simple scaffolding to hold the active proteins, not  as the piston pumping the ribosome engine. "No one took us  seriously," says Noller. "I was actually disinvited to write a chapter  for the ribosome book in 1973."

Being outsiders, or "oddballs" as Noller says, proved a boon to  the small UCSC contingent. "We had almost ten years of unmolested  progress," he says. By the time other researchers recognized the  importance of ribosomal RNA, Noller's group had successfully  dissected the molecule, mapped its parts and structure, and deduced  much of its mechanism.

Still, ribosomes are so incredibly complex, their remaining  mysteries will probably keep Noller and his students busy for years  to come. "It's a life's work for any hundred people put together, I  think," he says. He views the challenge with enthusiasm: "It's the  most worthwhile thing I could imagine doing in science."
