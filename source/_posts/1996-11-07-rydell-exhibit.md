SANTA CRUZ, CA--California landscape and visual artist Roy Rydell  is the subject of dual exhibitions taking place in Santa Cruz and at  the University of California, Santa Cruz. The UCSC exhibit runs from  Friday, November 14, through Friday, December 13, at Special  Collections in the McHenry Library. A reception is planned from 4 to  6 p.m. on November 15 at Special Collections. The reception is free  and open to the public.

Rydell has been leaving his verdant mark on the California  landscape since the late 1940s. Local spots that have flourished  under Rydell's green thumb include the Pacific Garden Mall (which he  helped design), the lush surroundings of Santa Cruz City Hall, and  Alfred Hitchcock's Scotts Valley estate. A longtime resident of  Bonny Doon, Rydell is also an accomplished visual artist.

The exhibit, which is drawn from Special Collections' Roy  Rydell Archive, includes such items as sketchbooks, jewelry and  landscape designs, photographs, selections of Rydell's artwork, and  correspondence between Rydell and Alfred Hitchcock. Rydell has  designed and installed a special sculpture for the exhibit, which will  be unveiled at the November 15 reception. The UCSC show is being  presented in conjunction with an exhibit at the Santa Cruz Art  League titled Distinguished Artists 1996 that features the works of  Roy Rydell and Ted Orland.
