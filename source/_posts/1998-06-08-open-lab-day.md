SANTA CRUZ, CA-The mysteries and splendors of the sea will be on display at the Long Marine Laboratory's "Open Labs Day" on Saturday, June 13, from 1 to 4 p.m. Marine enthusiasts of all ages are invited for behind-the-scenes tours of the working research labs and a chance to meet some of the researchers and the marine animals they study.

This special event is being offered to celebrate both the beginning of summer and the National Ocean Conference being held in Monterey June 11-12. Saturday's activities usher in the summer season at the lab. The lab's visitor center features displays and activities on the study of marine life, including a multimedia display on sea lions, a children's puppet corner, and hands-on activities. New animals on display in the public aquarium include a newly hatched skate and colorful sea slugs.

Long Marine Lab, a marine research facility operated by the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz, opened in 1978. IMS scientists work to understand Monterey Bay's unique environment and explore other issues in the ocean sciences worldwide. The lab's education programs for schoolchildren and the general public draw more than 30,000 guests each year.

Highlights of the open lab day include regular tours of the marine mammal area and public aquarium and visits to the moon jelly lab, the predator-prey study lab, and the larval culture lab. The open labs will give visitors an opportunity to view and learn about current research projects.

Special tours of a new state marine wildlife facility next door to the lab will also be available. These tours of the California Department of Fish and Game's Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center will leave from Long Marine Lab every 30 minutes from 1 to 4 p.m. They will be led by Long Marine Lab docents and education staff.

The Long Marine Lab's regular admission cost is $2 for adults, $1 for seniors and students, and free for children under 16. No reservations or extra fees are required for the special tours. For more information, call Long Marine Lab at (408) 459-2883.
