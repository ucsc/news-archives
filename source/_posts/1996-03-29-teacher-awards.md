SANTA CRUZ, CA--An innovative teacher-training program led by the  University of California, Santa Cruz, that provides professional  guidance and support for teachers during their first two years in the  classroom is receiving an award for excellence from a statewide  educational group today (Friday, March 29, 1996).

The California Council on the Education of Teachers is  awarding the Santa Cruz New Teacher Project/Beginning Teacher  Support and Assessment Program (SCNTP/BTSA) its Quality of  Education Award for the project's work with Starlight Elementary  School in the Pajaro Valley Unified School District.

The award recognizes partnerships between universities and  public schools, says Bob Curley, chair of the council's awards  committee and director of secondary education at San Jose State  University. "The project has made significant contributions both to  the school and the district and as a model for teacher preparation  throughout California," says Curley.

SCNTP/BTSA is a program of support and assessment that  helps new teachers as they enter the profession of teaching. A  collaborative effort by the Board of Studies in Education at UCSC,  the Santa Cruz County Office of Education, and more than a dozen  school districts in the greater Santa Cruz area, the project has  worked since 1988 with more than 450 beginning teachers to  promote excellent teaching.

"Research shows that teachers who receive this type of  assistance demonstrate higher levels of professional development  and are better able to work with culturally and linguistically  diverse students," says Ellen Moir, director of teacher education at  UCSC and director of SCNTP/BTSA. After nearly eight years, less  than 10 percent of teachers who participated with SCNTP/BTSA have  left teaching--compared to a national dropout rate of nearly 50  percent.

During the 1995-96 school year, eight veteran teachers have  been released from their regular classroom duties to work with  nearly 100 new teachers being served by the project. These veteran  teachers, known as new teacher advisers, observe and coach the new  teachers, offer emotional support, assist with short- and long-term  planning, design classroom-management strategies, teach  demonstration lessons, provide curriculum resources, and facilitate  communication with the principal.

The California Council on the Education of Teachers (CCET) is a  statewide organization of teacher educators. Its members represent  most of the state's institutions of higher education that have  teacher education programs, says Curley.

The CCET award is the second time in recent months that  SCNTP/BTSA has been recognized for its work. The project also  received the Parade of Excellence award from the National Council  of States for the Improvement of Education (NCSIE). The NCSIE  Parade of Excellence award recognizes programs that exemplify  educational excellence. SCNTP/BTSA was one of only six programs  that received the national distinction at the Nineteenth Annual  NCSIE Conference in Anaheim in November.
