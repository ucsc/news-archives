SANTA CRUZ, CA--From kitchen scraps to municipal waste,  earthworms are capable of transforming tons of organic matter into  low-cost, usable fertilizer and compost. Known as vermiculture, the  raising of earthworms to transform organic waste into useful  products is gaining support from environmentalists, city planners,  farmers, and educators.

On Monday, July 18, one of the world's leading experts on  vermiculture will present a free public lecture at 7 p.m. at the  University of California, Santa Cruz. Uday Bhawalkar is the director  of the Bhawalkar Earthworm Research Institute in India. Since 1981,  Bhawalkar has pioneered the large-scale use of vermiculture to  process waste from dairies, sugar mills, distilleries, tanneries,  slaughterhouses, pulp and paper processing plants, and food  processing operations. More than 5,000 farmers in India are using  vermiculture to process vegetative and animal waste into fertilizer.

Vermiculture can be used on a small scale in the home or on a  large scale in commercial operations, says Matt Werner, a soil  biologist with the UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food  Systems (formerly the Agroecology Program). "A box of earthworms  can turn kitchen scraps into fertilizer for your garden without the  hassle of building a compost pile," says Werner. "On a larger scale,  there's a business in southern California that contracts with cities  to recycle yard waste, and it uses earthworms to process 10 to 15  tons of waste a day. And Cuba produces 100,000 tons of earthworm  castings annually that they use as fertilizer."

To learn more about vermiculture, attend Bhawalkar's talk at  the Louise Cain Gatehouse at the entrance to the UCSC Farm. For  more information, call (408) 459-4140.
