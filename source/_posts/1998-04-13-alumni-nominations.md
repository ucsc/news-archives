All members of the campus community are invited to submit nominations for the 1998-99 Alumni Association awards. Three awards are given annually; one each to a faculty member, a staff member, and an alumnus or alumna of the campus.

The association holds a tribute luncheon in honor of award recipients. Faculty and staff winners each receive a $500 cash award.

Descriptions of the awards are as follows:
* The **Distinguished Teaching Award** recognizes extraordinary dedication to teaching at UCSC. Among its criteria are enthusiasm and creativity in communicating subject matter, ability to provoke critical thinking, and a deep commitment to students.
* The **Outstanding Staff Award** recognizes sustained, distinguished service by a staff member to student life.
* The **Alumni Achievement Award** is presented to a graduate whose personal achievement has brought distinction to the university.

The deadline for nominations is Friday, May 29.

To nominate someone for an Alumni Award, you'll need a nomination form. You can [print one][3] directly from the Web, but you'll need Acrobat Reader to do so. 

You can also request a nomination form by contacting the Alumni Office.
