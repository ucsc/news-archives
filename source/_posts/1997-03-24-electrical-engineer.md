Two Academic Senate committees have endorsed the proposed major in electrical engineering, the final step in the campus approval process, said Executive Vice Chancellor R. Michael Tanner.

"Implementation of the electrical engineering undergraduate major represents a critical step forward in the development of engineering programs at UC Santa Cruz," Tanner said.

The Academic Senate Committee on Planning and Budget and Committee on Educational Policy recently endorsed the program, completing the campus approval process.

Freshmen will be admitted to the bachelor of science major beginning next fall. As faculty are hired, the curriculum expanded, and new facilities made available, the program will begin accepting more advanced students into the major, including transfer students from other institutions, Tanner said.
