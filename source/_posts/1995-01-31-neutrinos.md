**Paper To Appear In Physical Review Letters Explains The Cosmological Consequences Of Neutrinos With Mass. It Also Predicts The Most Likely  Scenario: Two Species Of Neutrino With The Same Mass.**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The discovery that the ghostly particles called  neutrinos may have a small mass supports a special class of  theoretical models of how the universe has evolved, according to a  group of scientists led by cosmologist Joel Primack of the  University of California, Santa Cruz.

An article in today's edition of the New York Times reveals  that physicists at Los Alamos National Laboratory have found strong  evidence that neutrinos have mass. For now, the physicists have  disclosed only a range of possible masses. But if their claim holds  up, says Primack, "This would be one of the great discoveries of  physics. It would change our whole picture of particle physics and  cosmology."

In particular, neutrinos with mass would have deep  implications for models of the universe that probe how its structure  is influenced by "dark matter"--the mysterious material that  appears to make up most of the universe's mass. The gravitational  pull of dark matter, cosmologists concur, controlled the evolution of  galaxies and will dictate the fate of the universe. However, they  have disagreed over whether neutrinos play an important role. The  experiments at Los Alamos could turn the tide.

Primack's group will publish its latest results on the  implications of neutrino mass for cosmology in an upcoming issue of  the journal Physical Review Letters. Primack, professor of physics  at UCSC, is first author; coauthors are Jon Holtzman of Lowell  Observatory, Anatoly Klypin of New Mexico State University, and  David Caldwell of UC Santa Barbara.

The preliminary range of neutrino masses cited by the Los  Alamos team is vanishingly small, from one-half to five electron  volts. That translates to between a millionth and a hundred- thousandth of the mass of another minuscule particle, the electron.  However, neutrinos are ubiquitous: There are about 100 of them in  every chunk of space the size of a sugar cube, and about a billion of  them for every electron and proton in the universe. Even a tiny mass,  then, could mean that neutrinos are a crucial element of dark matter.

According to the detailed computer simulations by Primack and  his colleagues, neutrinos should compose about one-fifth of the  mass of the universe. That fraction is consistent with the early  results from Los Alamos.

Moreover, neutrinos represent a special kind of dark matter,  called "hot" dark matter. Some cosmologists have argued that all of  the universe's dark matter is "cold"--massive particles that moved  sluggishly one year after the Big Bang. Others maintain that some of  the dark matter must consist of "hot" particles, such as neutrinos,  which zipped near the speed of light in the same era. Both the early  Los Alamos findings and astronomical observations strongly support  a dark-matter recipe with cold plus hot ingredients, Primack says.

In its Physical Review Letters paper, Primack's group states  that a model using two types of neutrino, each with a mass of about  2.4 electron volts, offers the best theoretical solution yet to the  dark-matter puzzle. The researchers call on several lines of  evidence to support this view:

* Results from the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector  (LSND) at Los Alamos. Those results, the authors emphasize, are  preliminary and unpublished, but they are consistent with those  reported today in the New York Times. (Caldwell is a member of the  LSND team.)
* Results from another neutrino experiment, at the Kamiokande  detector in Japan. Those data, published last year, do not point to a  specific neutrino mass. However, they indicate that two species of  neutrino, the "muon" and "tau" neutrinos, may have about the same  mass.
* Attempts to match the results of computer simulations with  observations of galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and distant objects  that formed within a billion years or so of the Big Bang. To match  the newest observations most closely, the team concluded that its  computer models require a neutrino mass of about five electron  volts. That corresponds to about 20 percent of the total mass of the  universe. Further, the most recent model by Primack's group shows  that splitting the mass evenly between two species of neutrino  produces an even tighter fit to all available data from telescopes,  satellites, and experiments in particle physics.

The researchers make other key assumptions, some of which  are under debate. For instance, the team's model features a universe  with just enough matter to slow down its expansion perpetually, but  not enough to make it recollapse. Other cosmologists claim that the  universe contains less than this critical density of matter. They  invoke some other factor, such as Einstein's "cosmological  constant," to complete their models. In addition, Primack's group  assumes that the universe is older and is expanding more slowly  than some recent studies indicate. Further measurements of this  rate of expansion, known as the "Hubble constant," should help settle  the issue.

"Neutrinos with mass will force us to zero in on a small class  of models as acceptable," Primack says. "Even the existence of only  one species of neutrino with a mass of two or more electron volts is  essentially fatal for models that rely upon a small density of cold  dark matter plus a cosmological constant. This probably is the most  popular class of models today, but the Los Alamos results may rule  it out.

"The purpose of our paper is not to claim that we now have the  right model," Primack says. "It is not yet clear that two equal-mass  neutrinos is the best model for the hot dark matter. But it makes a  nice consistent picture, and it is highly predictive--it can be shot  down by observations being done right now. If it survives for a few  years, it may even be right."

Primack continues: "We still don't know what the dark matter  is, and we don't know how old the universe is. But this is the  wonderful moment in history when we might be able to solve these  problems, perhaps even by the end of the present decade."

The researchers considered many models with various kinds of  neutrinos of different masses, using computer codes developed  mainly by Holtzman. They ran a simulation of the most promising  model on the CONVEX C-3880 supercomputer at the National Center  for Supercomputing Applications in Illinois.

The simulation, created primarily by Klypin, tracks the paths  of 50 million particles in a random cube of the universe about 300  million light-years across. The cube contains 512 million resolution  elements through which the particles move. The program uses the  cold plus hot dark matter model with two equal-mass neutrinos as a  starting point for the simulated universe. It then lets the particles  interact by standard laws of physics until gravity pulls them  together--over billions of computer "years"--to form galaxies,  clusters, and superclusters. Various analytical techniques allow the  team to gauge how closely its results match the structures found to  date in the real universe.
