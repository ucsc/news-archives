SAN FRANCISCO, CA--The conveyance of 962 acres of federal land at  Ford Ord to the University of California, accepted today (Friday, July  15) by UC's Board of Regents, sets the stage for a vital base-reuse  project to proceed in earnest: UC's multi-institutional center for  science, technology, education, and policy, known as the "STEP  center."

Project leaders at UC Santa Cruz will now develop detailed  plans for the physical use of the land, as well as business and  programmatic plans for the collaborative complex they envision.  Many public and private agencies already have expressed interest in  the center, which is intended to foster economic redevelopment in  the region and to help California and the nation address some of the  critical issues--particularly coastal and environmental concerns-- they will face in the decades to come.

The center will be located on a site adjacent to base land the  Department of the Army has conveyed to the California State  University system for the purposes of developing a new CSU campus.

"We look forward to the opportunities this unique arrangement  provides for the reuse of military facilities for the economic,  social, and technological well-being of the region, the state, and the  nation," says UC President Jack W. Peltason. "In its role as a  research university, the University of California has been a major  force in the state's economy. California will further profit by this  new and exciting enterprise which combines the resources and  expertise of UC, the California State University, the Department of  Defense, other federal and state agencies, and private business."

"The university is indebted to the efforts of Congressman Sam  Farr to make this opportunity a reality," says Chancellor Karl S.  Pister of UCSC. "We feel strongly that we have the place, the people,  and a vision--all solidly founded in the attributes of the Monterey  Bay Area. We are eager to move ahead to demonstrate to the state  and the nation how base conversion can be accomplished."

Farr's predecessor, newly named White House Chief of Staff  Leon Panetta, and State Senator Henry Mello, who authored state  legislation establishing the Fort Ord Reuse Authority, also have  played key roles as reuse plans for the military base have been  developed, Pister noted. State Assemblyman Bruce McPherson's  support has also been critical to the success of the base conversion  effort, the chancellor said.

The initial planned conveyance to UC includes about 400 acres  of developable land next to Fritzsche Air Field, along Reservation  Road. One usable structure sits on this property: the base's former  flight-simulator building, which contains offices and will serve as  on-site headquarters for the STEP center. No other changes will  occur on the rest of the land until project planners prepare an  environmental impact report and solicit public comment.

In addition, the property conveyed to UC will feature about 530  acres of some of the richest coastal chaparral in California. Many  rare plant and animal species inhabit this land, located just over a  mile from Monterey Bay. These habitats will be preserved as open  space for teaching and research under the auspices of UC's Natural  Reserve System and the Campus Reserve System of UC Santa Cruz.

"This land will be an exquisite addition to the UC and Campus  Reserve systems--it contains unique vegetation not found in any of  the other reserves," says Margaret Fusari, natural reserve  coordinator at UCSC. Fusari's office will oversee the care of the  land, in collaboration with the federal Bureau of Land Management  and the state parks system. She proposes to work with the UCSC  Arboretum to propagate some of the rare and endangered species of  plants on the property.

UCSC's visions for Fort Ord have progressed steadily since the  idea for the STEP center was developed more than two years ago. As  now conceived, the center would draw upon the scientific expertise  assembled near Monterey Bay, in Silicon Valley, throughout the UC  system, and in the national laboratories administered by UC. Many of  its program areas would reflect the unique natural assets of the bay  and the region.

"There may never be as good an opportunity for UCSC to  collaborate with research groups, government agencies, and private  industry," says James Gill, associate vice chancellor for research  and director of UCSC's Fort Ord project. "That's why there is such  excitement about this project, both here and in Washington, D.C."

Although UCSC will administer the center initially, Gill  emphasizes that it will require significant participation from other  institutions to thrive: "This is not a place at which UC will build  buildings or provide classroom instruction in the near term. The  ability to create jobs and to stimulate the economy will be a  function of the region's ability to attract agencies, businesses, and  investment to the site."

The Department of Defense has proclaimed the region's overall  blueprint for Fort Ord as one of four "model projects" nationally for  the conversion of former military bases to civilian uses. CSU- Monterey Bay, with its planned emphases on marine and  environmental sciences, language and culture, and education, forms  the other cornerstone of the reuse plan and complements the STEP  center in numerous ways.

"The Monterey Bay region is being recognized as an emerging  center for marine and environmental sciences," says Lora Lee Martin,  the project's director of program and policy development. "We plan  to develop a truly integrated research complex to take advantage of  those strengths, create new jobs for the region, and develop new  products."

As UC's plans have matured, several areas of research and  potential product development have come into focus. They include  the following:

\-- Global environmental change, especially in coastal regions.  Participants would develop new ways to monitor the world's oceans,  biosphere, and atmosphere; analyze data rapidly; and predict the  possible effects of climate change.

\-- Environmental restoration and management. Fort Ord, which  is on the federal "superfund" list, is one of twenty sites chosen by  the Western Governors Association for the demonstration of new  environmental technologies. Special challenges include volatile  compounds in aquifers and munitions, and heavy metals in soils.

\-- Agriculture and aquaculture. The site is surrounded by  equally rich farmland and sea. The future health of the region's  economy, the center's planners say, depends critically upon learning  how to sustain these harvests.

\-- Bioresources. The bay and its surrounding coastal habitats  contain one of the world's richest and most diverse collections of  species. Biologists would study how to preserve that diversity and  search for possible human benefits, such as new drugs and foods.

\-- Transportation and energy. Engineers would explore electric  vehicles, "smart" highway systems, and other methods of reducing  the environmental problems caused by society's reliance on fossil  fuels.

\-- Language and culture. Higher-education leaders signed an  agreement in May to form a Center for Intensive Language and  Culture in the Monterey Bay region. Further collaboration with  experts at the UC center and CSU-Monterey Bay promises to bring  world prominence to the region in these fields.

Participants would concentrate on several dimensions within  each of those areas. For instance, information technology will  become critical to connect researchers at a distance and to transfer  huge amounts of data. Already, researchers at several local  institutions are forging such links--with help from federal grants  and agencies such as Pacific Bell--to develop the site's potential as  a major intersection on the information superhighway. Scientific  instrumentation will be another focus; planners expect an industry  to emerge in the area for the design and manufacture of  sophisticated sensors for marine, atmospheric, and earth sciences.

Education and public policy are two other important  components. For example, students at both CSU and UCSC will have  access to the center's resources to enhance their degree programs.  Other participants will create new ways of training teachers and  educating the general public about the environment. Scientists,  social scientists, and engineers from all of the member groups will  consider the economic and environmental policy implications of  their work.

UC's Fort Ord project team is now in the midst of a two-year  planning phase to define the scope of the project, says L. Edwin  Coate, vice chancellor for business and administrative services,  whose office is overseeing the physical, environmental, and business  planning for the project. The group has contracted with Sedway  Cooke Associates, an urban and environmental planning and design  firm from San Francisco, to develop a master plan of land-use  guidelines for the STEP center.

"Given our vision of the project and the constraints of the site,  the master plan will guide us on how to accommodate our program  and respect the landscape," says Michael Houlemard, director of  physical and environmental planning for the project. A public hearing  will be scheduled to solicit comments on the master plan.

UC's Fort Ord project team participates in meetings of the  newly established Fort Ord Reuse Authority by sending an ex officio  member. As the project evolves, planners will work with other  jurisdictions affected by the project, such as the City of Marina and  the County of Monterey.

To support this preliminary work on the STEP center, UCSC has  received $725,000 from a federal Department of Commerce grant to  Monterey County and several hundred thousand dollars from state and  local contributions.
