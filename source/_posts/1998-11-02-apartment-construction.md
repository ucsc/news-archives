Construction crews broke ground on the Colleges Nine and Ten apartments in October. The apartments, located behind Social Sciences 1 and 2, will house 280 undergraduate students.

Approximately 35 nearby parking spaces are being used as a construction staging area. The university will replace some 20 of those spaces this month by making the College Nine access road one-way and allowing parking on the west side of that road, said Steve Ayraud, principal engineer with Physical Planning and Construction.

In addition to the replacement parking, the two buildings have been provided front-door shuttle service, and police have stepped up efforts to cite people parking without proper permits, he added.

Preliminary design is also under way for a dining hall and residence halls for Colleges Nine and Ten. Each of the two residence halls will house 400 students. Construction is anticipated to start in spring 2000.

In a related project, TAPS will install stop signs at the intersection of McLaughlin Drive and the College Ten access road to improve safety at that intersection, Ayraud said.
