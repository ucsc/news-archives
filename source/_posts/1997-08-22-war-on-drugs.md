SANTA CRUZ, CA--The 'War on Drugs' and the crack cocaine scare that gripped  the nation from 1986 to 1992 triggered the most massive wave of  imprisonment in the country's history and eroded civil rights, say the authors  of a new book called Crack in America: Demon Drugs and Social Justice.

Crack in America focuses attention on how politicians and the media  embraced drug war rhetoric and helped fuel a surge of spending on law  enforcement and antidrug campaigns. But the drug war only obscured the  impact of crack cocaine on its real victims: some poor residents of urban  America, mostly African American and Latino, who turned to crack for a brief  respite from the social and economic problems that underlie most drug abuse.

Written by a team of veteran drug researchers in law, medicine, and the  social sciences, and edited by sociology professors Craig Reinarman of the  University of California, Santa Cruz, and Harry G. Levine of Queens College,  City University of New York, Crack in America reveals the failings of U.S. drug  policy.

"Beginning in 1986, crack cocaine was portrayed as a drug that  threatened the very fabric of American life," said Reinarman, who also  coauthored six chapters with Levine. "Politicians played on those fears to  justify a nationwide law enforcement crackdown, but the use of crack  cocaine was never widespread, and its addictive qualities were vastly  exaggerated."

Among the themes presented in Crack in America are:
* Existing drug laws with long mandatory minimum sentences were  passed during a moment of extreme antidrug hysteria that is almost  unprecedented in our nation's history.
* The fundamental assumptions about addiction that undergird these  laws are often erroneous and misleading; most Americans who have used  crack never became addicts; crack is not measurably more addictive than  powder cocaine; there is no such thing as a "crack baby."
* Other nations comparable to the United States have not experienced  significant crack problems because they have stronger social and health  programs, less poverty and inequality, and more humane and effective drug  policies.
* The costs to taxpayers of current laws and policies have quadrupled in  the past decade with no real reduction in supply or abuse.
* U.S. drug policy is a vestige of alcohol prohibition that persists-- largely for political rather than medical or scientific reasons--despite  massive failures.
* The excesses of the 'War on Drugs' have spawned the most organized  and articulate mass movement for drug policy reform since the repeal of  alcohol prohibition.

Federal sentencing laws passed during the crack scare require five-year  mandatory minimum sentences for anyone convicted of possessing five grams  of crack cocaine. By contrast, mandatory sentences for possession of  powdered cocaine only apply to those holding 500 grams or more. Reinarman  noted that nearly 90 percent of crack cocaine users are African American,  while 90 percent of powdered cocaine users are white. These laws flooded  prisons with African American men and led to massive prison overcrowding  and a wave of prison construction, said Reinarman.

During the current congressional debate on the disparity in sentencing  laws for possession of crack and powdered cocaine, Congressman John  Conyers distributed copies of Crack in America to all the members of the  Congressional Black Caucus.

Joseph McNamara, former chief of police in San Jose, California, and  now a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, is one of the few  law enforcement officials who broke ranks during the drug war to decry the  hysteria. He calls Crack in America "a penetrating analysis which explodes  the government-propagated myths regarding crack cocaine."

Outspoken critics of U.S. drug policy today include William F. Buckley,  Hugh Downs, Milton Friedman, and Walter Cronkite. Voters in California and  Arizona recently passed laws legalizing the use of medical marijuana, and  there is growing opposition to law enforcement use of helicopters for  marijuana surveillance and to drug testing in the workplace, said Reinarman.  "For the first time since the late 1960s, there is a real debate going on about  drug policy," said Reinarman. "It's not just the liberal left--there is  opposition from Republicans and Democrats, and at the grassroots level and  among the very elite. Drug policy is being contested."

Biographical information about Craig Reinarman:  Reinarman is a leading authority on U.S. drug policy and a member of the  advisory board of the Drug Policy Foundation in Washington, D.C.
