SANTA CRUZ, CA--Professor emeritus of biology Charles Daniel, one  of the founding faculty members at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, has been appointed dean of the Division of Graduate  Studies at UCSC. Daniel's appointment, the result of an on-campus  search, took effect August 1.

Daniel will oversee programs and issues that affect the nearly  1,000 graduate students at UCSC, such as recruitment, teaching and  research support, enrollment planning, and graduate student life.  Because Daniel participated in the VERIP III retirement program  earlier this year, he will serve as dean on recall status at 49  percent time.

Daniel replaces professor of linguistics Jorge Hankamer, who  had served as acting dean of the Division of Graduate Studies and  Research. That position was restructured this year into two part- time positions: Daniel's post and the associate vice chancellor for  research, held by professor of earth sciences James Gill.

Daniel is noted for his research on growth and aging processes  in cells, particularly in mammary glands. His work has implications  for understanding how mammary tissues develop, both in health and  during diseases such as breast cancer. The National Institutes of  Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation, and two drug  companies have funded Daniel's work nearly continuously since 1968.  He recently received a major new grant for breast-cancer research  from the U.S. Army and another large grant from the NIH to support  new studies on the interactions of hormones with the breast.

Previous administrative positions held by Daniel include acting  associate academic vice chancellor and chairman of the Biology  Department. Earlier this year, he received the "outstanding faculty  award" from his peers in UCSC's Natural Sciences Division. He joined  the faculty in 1965.
