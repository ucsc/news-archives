**Business, Education, And Government Leaders Focus On The Technology  Revolution In The Classroom**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The California Council on Science and Technology  (CCST), the leading partnership of officials from academia,  government, and industry in California, held a two-day "education  summit" this week at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  Attendees at the summit, held on May 21 and 22, focused on how to  improve the use of the World Wide Web and other advanced  communication and computing technologies in education at the K-12  and university levels. UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Karl S. Pister, who has chaired the  CCST Board of Directors for five years, hosted the summit. Speakers  included representatives of the governor's office, the state  Department of Education, several universities and colleges, and  firms such as Apple Computer, NETSchools, The Learning Company,  and Jones Digital Century, Inc.

"We want to initiate a call to action by the CCST to provide the  leadership needed to make these new technologies available to every  educator in California," said Ed Zschau, former U.S. congressman and  chair of the CCST education committee. "I assert that technology  will revolutionize education within the next five years, and that  California should provide the leadership to make this happen. In my  opinion, we haven't done that yet."

Indeed, Pister noted, California ranks in the bottom 10 percent  of states in terms of student access to computers in the classroom.  "Clearly, the use of technology in education at every level presents  us with enormous challenges and opportunities," Pister said. "CCST  is a means for us to involve both the academic and business  communities, together with government agencies, to discuss how to  move toward the classrooms and campuses of the future."

At their private meetings, participants saw demonstrations of  communication and computing technologies, with a focus on the  tremendous power and flexibility of the World Wide Web. Members of  both the CCST Board of Directors and the overall council discussed  how to help shape the state's policy on technology in the classroom.

The state legislature created CCST in 1988 to provide  independent findings on public-policy issues in science and  technology that affect the state's economy. The council comprises  30 corporate CEOs, academicians, scientists, and eminent scholars,  directed by a 11-member Board of Directors. Six key academic  institutions sponsor the council: the University of California,  California State University, the California Community Colleges, the  California Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and the  University of Southern California.

The primary objectives of CCST, which meets four times each  year, are as follows:
* identify the long-range research requirements to sustain the  state's economic development and competitiveness;
* provide direction for new scientific and technological  activities;
* stimulate technology-transfer links between university  researchers and the private sector;
* produce analysis of public-policy issues and create policy  recommendations in the areas of science and technology;
* establish an organizational structure to develop  collaborative public/private sector initiatives targeted to spur  research and development activities, innovation, and growth of new  industries and jobs in science and technology.
