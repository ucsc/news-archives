Got a big camping trip planned for the spring, but no tent to sleep in? Want to try surfing, but not ready to buy a board and wet suit? The Outdoor Equipment Rental Center at the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports (OPERS) can help you gear up for any trip or outdoor adventure.

The center is open to all students, staff, and faculty and rents camping and mountaineering gear, water sports equipment, and bicycle gear at extremely reasonable prices (for example, a surfboard rents for $6 per day and $12 for the weekend; a 2-3 person tent can be rented for $8 per weekend and $16 per week).

Located upstairs in the East Field House, the rental shop is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday and Friday and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday.

Along with renting equipment, OPERS Recreation Program also offers a range of wilderness trips and classes to students, faculty, staff, and the community. Sign up for spring trips and classes begins January 13. Among the trips being offered this spring are rafting on Oregon's Rogue River, backcountry skiing in Yosemite, and rock climbing in Joshua Tree. Classes include yoga, pottery, guitar, drumming, dance, and massage. Complete descriptions and listings can be found in the _Winter '99 Recreation Intramural and Sports Guide_ booklets, which are located at various sites across the campus.

While you're thinking about outdoor equipment, bring your bike up to the East Field House for free bike maintenance on Fridays from 2 to 5 p.m. (This program is cosponsored by OPERS and Transportation and Parking Services.)

To register for classes or for more information, call OPERS at (831) 459-2806.
