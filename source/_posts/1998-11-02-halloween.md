![\[Photo of costumed staff\]][1] Even though Halloween fell on a Saturday this year, many members of the campus community slipped into their costumes on the preceding Friday. And, true to the Halloween tradition at UCSC, many of the celebrants dropped by the Photo Lab for a courtesy snapshot. As is our custom, here is a small sampling of the photos. We begin with this group, reportedly from CATS. If you can put names to faces (masks), send e-mail topioweb@cats.ucsc.edu. Here's who we (think we) know: (l-r) Sheila Blust, Brian Malo, Naomi Gunther, and (far right) Ruben Trujillo.
