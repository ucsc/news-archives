SANTA CRUZ, CA--Faculty and staff at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, received $38.8 million in contracts and grants for  research last year, an increase of 19.5 percent from the amount  received the previous year and twice the funding acquired just five  years ago.

The 1994-95 year marked UCSC's thirteenth consecutive year  of growth in research funding. The campus secured $32.4 million in  contracts and grants in 1993-94. Public and private grants are  included in the annual total reported by UCSC's Contracts and Grants  Office.

"The increase is remarkable given the grim federal funding  climate and early retirement of many professors," said James Gill,  associate vice chancellor for research and professor of earth  sciences at UCSC. He attributes much of the growth to active  research programs sponsored by faculty and staff hired in the past  several years.

A total of 519 awards were received this past year, compared  to 448 awards earned in 1993-94. Principal funders included the  National Science Foundation ($8 million), the National Institutes of  Health ($5.3 million), the U.S. Department of Education ($4.1  million), the Office of Naval Research ($3.1 million), the U.S.  Department of Energy ($1.9 million), and the California Association  for Research in Astronomy ($1.8 million).

As with most research universities, UCSC takes in more money  from its sponsored research than from student fees. The research  enriches the teaching program by including students in the pursuit of  new knowledge, Gill said. It also makes the Monterey Bay region  more attractive to businesses that benefit from university-based  research programs, he added.

In 1994-95, UCSC's total budget was $203.4 million. Major  components included $102.8 million in general funds, $38.8 million  in contracts and grants, and $29.9 million in student fees.
