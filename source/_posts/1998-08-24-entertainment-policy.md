title: Summary Of Entertainment Policy Changes
author: UCSC Currents

As you read through the policy changes below, please make note of the distinction between "allowable" and "exceptional" entertainment. The new policy has expanded the definition of "allowable" activities, but some "allowable" entertainment may be considered "exceptional" in that these expenses must be explicitly approved by a Senior Administrative Officer.

**Maximums Increased**

Effective July 1, 1998 the maximum per person expenditures for individuals being entertained and for a University employee who is the official host or who is a participant at the request of the official host shall not exceed the following amounts (inclusive of tax and service):
* Breakfast $10.00
* Lunch $20.00
* Dinner $40.00
* Light Refreshment $10.00

**Buffet Reception **

Cannot exceed the applicable meal allowance associated with the type of buffet, i.e., breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

Any request for reimbursement which exceeds the per person meal allowance is considered "exceptional expense" and must include a written justification as to why the higher costs were unavoidable and necessary to achieve a University business purpose. The fact that actual costs exceed the authorized rates is not in itself adequate justification for a higher reimbursement rate.

**Expansion of the allowable entertainment activities **

To include functions such as:
* faculty/staff picnics
* holiday parties
* employee recognition or length of service awards
* retirement presentations

provided that the cost of such functions is paid from funds which have no restrictions regarding entertainment (state funds may not be used).

Employee personal expenses such as birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, farewell gatherings (other than retirement), illnesses, sympathy, Secretary's Day, etc. are not allowable expenses.

**Host Certification **

Requirement that the entertainment reimbursement include a statement signed by the host certifying that the expenditures were incurred for official University business purposes.

**Authorizations**

Requirement that the authorization of entertainment transactions be independent and at the appropriate level, i.e. the supervisor (or higher level) of the official host.

**Approvals **

Senior Administrative Officers have been delegated authority to approve entertainment. Senior Administrative Officers may redelegate the authority in writing to another person within their unit. The authority may not be further redelegated.

Senior Administrative Officers have been delegated authority to approve exceptional entertainment. Senior Administrative Officers may not redelegate the authority.

**Exceptional Entertainment**

The following expenses, although allowable, require Senior Administrative Officer approval and must be paid from appropriate non-State funds:
* expenses incurred for the spouse of a guest or the official host (provided that the presence of the spouse serves a bona fide business purpose)
* faculty/staff picnics
* holiday parties
* employee recognition or length of service awards
* retirement presentations - student commencement exercises
* tickets to entertainment or sporting events
* entertainment expenditures which exceed the per person meal allowance (see justification required above)

SPECIAL NOTE: Under IRS regulations, an entertainment expense will be considered taxable income to the employee if the entertainment activity is not directly related to the employee's job, the expense is lavish or extravagant under the circumstances, the official host (or another employee) is not present when the activity takes place, or if the expense is not substantiated with supporting documentation as provided in the policy. Such expenses are not allowable under this policy.
