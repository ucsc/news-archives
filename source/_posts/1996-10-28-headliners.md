With affirmative action in the news daily, sociologist **Dana Takagi** is getting calls, most recently from the _San Francisco Examiner_, which did a story about how Asian Americans are being divided by the issue.

Reporters continue to pursue the life on Mars story by examining what we know about how life may have arisen on Earth. The _Sacramento Bee_ turned to biochemist **David Deamer** to discuss how the first cell membranes might have coalesced. The _San Francisco Examiner_ also ran the article.   

A friend of seismologist **Ed Garnero** told him that BBC radio reported on his research (with mineral physicist **Quentin Williams**) on a partially molten layer deep within the planet. The item aired before a report that the rock band Oasis had broken up--big news in Britain, indeed.  

Conceptual artist **Victor Burgin's** new book, _Some Cities_, earned a favorable review in the _San Francisco Chronicle_. Burgin's book interweaves text and photographic images of cities around the world. The critic was moved by the text and images that he described as "full of mundane intrigue: the glances and comportment of strangers, the light and emptiness of unknown alleys and corridors, the sinister blankness of new architecture."  

Chemist **Joseph Bunnett's** extensive work on several projects dealing with the destruction of chemical weapons was profiled recently in _Chemistry International_. The journal reprinted the article from the alumni magazine of Reed College, where Bunnett earned a B.A. in 1942.

**Wendy Mink** of politics appeared on KSCO radio for a live, two-hour discussion of welfare reform.
