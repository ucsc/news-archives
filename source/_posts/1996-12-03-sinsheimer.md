SANTA CRUZ, CA--The oral history memoir of the fourth chancellor  of the University of California, Santa Cruz, has just been released.  The volume, Robert L. Sinsheimer: The University of California, Santa  Cruz, During a Critical Decade, 1977-1987, was produced by the  Regional History Project at UC Santa Cruz.

A molecular biologist of international distinction, Robert  Sinsheimer made significant breakthroughs in his field in 1967 when  he and several colleagues at the California Institute of Technology  and Stanford University succeeded in isolating, purifying, and  synthetically replicating the DNA of a virus. This was a feat of  genetic engineering never before accomplished.

Sinsheimer was one of the first to foresee the potential of  molecular biology and also one of the first to draw public attention  to ethical quandaries the new science would pose, including  uncontrolled recombinant DNA technology and cloning methods.

The oral history was compiled by documentary historian  Randall Jarrell, who heads the Regional History Project. Jarrell  conducted seven hours of taped interviews with Sinsheimer during  the 1990-91 academic year. The Regional History Project has used  oral history to document the history of the central coast of  California and the institutional history of UCSC since 1963. The  Sinsheimer oral history is part of the project's University History  series.

In this volume, Sinsheimer discusses his career and describes  his challenges and accomplishments during his decade as chancellor  of UCSC. He talks frankly about campus and community relations at  the time, initiatives to streamline campus administration, and  student activism. During his tenure, Sinsheimer oversaw a major  growth in student enrollments as well as the establishment of  programs in agroecology, applied economics, seismological studies,  and a major in computer engineering.

Born in Washington, D.C., Sinsheimer was the first scientist in  his family. He earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees from  M.I.T. Now chancellor emeritus and professor emeritus of biology at  UCSC, Sinsheimer taught at M.I.T., Iowa State College, and, for  twenty years, at Caltech, where he served as chair of the Biology  Department for nine years. Following his tenure at UCSC he taught  for two years at UC Santa Barbara.

Sinsheimer is a member of the National Academy of Sciences  and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the author of  more than 250 publications, including his autobiography, The Strands  of a Life: The Science of DNA and the Art of Education (University of  California Press, 1994).

Xeroxed, indexed copies of the oral history can be purchased at  cost for deposit in research collections and libraries. It is available  to readers and researchers in Special Collections, McHenry Library  at UCSC and at Bancroft Library, UC Berkeley.
