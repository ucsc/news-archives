![\[Photo of students at MESA Day\]][1] More than 500 students from schools throughout central California participated in the MESA Day activities at UCSC on May 1. Events included an egg drop contest in which containers designed by students to protect eggs were dropped from a hot air balloon.

MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement) is a UC program that serves educationally and economically disadvantaged students and emphasizes participation by students from groups with low rates of eligibility for four-year colleges.

![\[Photo of Robert Heredia\]][6] In the sail car contest, each team of students was given a piece of paper, plastic straws, and four wooden wheels from which to build a car that could be driven across the floor by the breeze from an electric fan. The radical design displayed here by judge Robert Heredia was among the most successful sail cars. It was designed by brothers Jesus and Diego Sosa of Santa Barbara High School.
