A professor of literature at UCSC, Mackey has authored nearly a dozen books and monographs and is the recipient of a 1993 Whiting Writers' Award. His interest in jazz and African culture informs his critically acclaimed work.

His compact disc recording Strick: Song of the Andoumboulou 16-25 (1995) presents him reading his work accompanied by musicians Royal Hartigan and Hafez Modirzadeh.

Mackey edits the literary journal Hambone and is coeditor of Moment's Notice: Jazz in Poetry and Prose (1993). He teaches creative writing and African American, contemporary, and experimental literature at UCSC.
