SANTA CRUZ, CA--Acidic water and ultraviolet light damage the  embryos of frogs far more seriously when acting in tandem rather  than as separate factors, according to a laboratory study at the  University of California, Santa Cruz.

Researchers exposed the eggs of a common species of frog to  various levels of acidity and UV-B radiation, the most harmful form  of ultraviolet light. By themselves, even the most acidic water or  the most severe UV-B radiation did not kill many embryos. But when  the team combined the two environmental assaults, as many as half  of the eggs failed to hatch.

Ecologists should look for similar interactions in nature as  they try to explain why many populations of amphibians around the  world are dying out, the study's authors say. Stresses such as  habitat loss, a thinning ozone layer, acid rain, pesticides, disease,  and global climate change may combine to wreak more havoc on  frogs, toads, and salamanders than any one factor could by itself.  Indeed, some scientists now suspect that for any given group of  amphibians in trouble, two or more such factors may interact  synergistically--that is, the combined effects of the stresses are  far greater than the sum of their individual effects.

"People have been looking for a smoking gun to explain the  amphibian die-offs, and there isn't just one smoking gun," says  Michael Soule, coauthor of the study and professor emeritus of  environmental studies at UCSC. "There's quite an armamentarium out  there. We're just beginning to look at the interactions among these  possible causes."

The UCSC group published its work in the October 1995 issue  of the scientific journal Conservation Biology. First author was  biologist Leslie Long, who completed the study for her master's  thesis in marine sciences. Coauthors were former UCSC  undergraduate Loralei Saylor, now at the Arizona Department of  Game & Fish, and Soule.

"We're not trying to say that a combination of UV radiation and  low pH is the answer for why a particular amphibian population is  declining, or even that this is happening now in the field," says Long.  "The main message is that synergisms can be important and are  worth looking for. We may miss a lot if we only look at each factor  in isolation."

Another recent study supports Long's view. Ecologists Joseph  Kiesecker and Andrew Blaustein at Oregon State University found  that a synergism between UV-B radiation and a fungal disease can  kill embryos of the Cascades frog and the western toad. The  combined effects of ultraviolet light and infection by the fungus  magnified the harm done to the eggs beyond the sum of the individual  effects of each factor. The work appeared in the November 21 issue  of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

In 1994, Blaustein's group also showed that UV-B light by  itself can kill frog and toad embryos in the field. "Both our new  paper and the Long paper show that we should look not just for  single effects, but also for combinations," Blaustein says. "We don't  think low pH is a factor in Oregon, but it may interact with UV  radiation in other parts of the country. UV is important here, but it  doesn't play a big role in the tropics. There will not be a single  global cause."

For their study, Long and her colleagues used three levels of  acidic water (pH readings of 6.0, 5.0, and 4.5) and three levels of  ultraviolet light: no UV-B (as a control), a "normal" level for high  elevations, and a level forecast if the ozone layer continues to thin.  The team exposed several dozen eggs of the leopard frog, Rana  pipiens, to one of the nine possible combinations of factors. About  one-quarter of the embryos died under the conditions of lowest pH  and moderate UV, while half died when subjected to the lowest pH  and the highest UV. In all other treatments--including the lowest pH  by itself and the highest UV by itself--at least 90 percent of the  eggs hatched.

Several caveats apply, the authors note. The highest level of  UV-B radiation simulated a future earth with an ozone layer 30  percent thinner than it was in 1979. The most acidic water had a pH  of 4.5, a reading seen infrequently in nature. Further, the study  considered only the lab effects of those factors on the eggs of one  species. In the wild, each of the many species of amphibian would  react differently at each stage of life to these and other stresses.

Acid rain can send pH levels as low as between 4.6 and 5.4 in  lakes in the eastern U.S., Canada, and Europe, research has shown.  Other workers have found pH levels of 4.5 in northern California and  5.0 in the Rocky Mountains. In addition, surges of acidified water  may occur in mountainous areas when snow melts in the spring.  High-elevation frogs breed in that season--a time of year when UV  radiation is near its peak, the UCSC team notes.

Soule hopes to work with a molecular biologist to explore why  the pH-UV double whammy harms the eggs. The team observed that  embryos died when their egg membranes did not expand, a "curling  defect" that trapped the growing tadpoles inside in tight coils.
