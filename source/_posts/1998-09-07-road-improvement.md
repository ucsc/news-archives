Work crews directed traffic on Coolidge Drive last week as they moved into the final stages of the road-improvement project near Physical Plant/Planning.

The $450,000 project includes widening Coolidge to provide left-turn pockets, moving and improving bus pullouts, and realigning the service road to the Blacksmith Shop and a section of the bike path. The  crews from Monterey Peninsula Engineering also laid back the hillside near Physical Plant/Planning to allow people better visibility around the bend of the hill.

"The intersection is being improved to make it  safer," said Margaret Holton of Physical Planning and Construction.

Crews are also installing electrical conduit so that a stoplight may be added at the intersection in the future.

Last week, workmen also ripped up a portion of the Carriage House access road to prepare it for resurfacing. The  pavement had been broken up over the years by the heavy-truck  traffic, said Holton.

This project is expected to be completed by September 18, when Coolidge Drive will be repaved at the project site and the Carriage House access road also repaved. People driving on Coolidge should be prepared for as much as a three-minute delay when entering or leaving the campus during this work.
