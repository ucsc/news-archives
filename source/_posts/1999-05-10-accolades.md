![][2] Joel Primack

The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany has selected professor of physics **Joel Primack** to receive a prestigious Humboldt Research Award. The Humboldt Research Awards, given to internationally recognized scholars outside Germany, include the invitation to undertake extended periods of research at German research institutes. The award will enable Primack to spend a total of one year in Germany over the next five years. Primack said he plans to use the award to make several visits to the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich and the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, and possibly short visits to other major German research centers. In addition to supporting his work in Germany, the Humboldt Foundation may also provide support for a German postdoctoral researcher to work with Primack in the United States.
