**Orin Martin,** manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden, will be honored for his years of service to organic gardening when he receives a Steward of Sustainable Agriculture award at the Ecological Farming Conference later this month.

The award honors "those special people who have been actively and critically involved in Sustainable Agriculture. These Stewards of Sustainable Agriculture have demonstrated their long-term, significant contributions to the well-being of agriculture and the planet."

Martin, who has managed the Chadwick Garden since 1977, will be recognized January 22 during the Eco-Farm gathering at the Asilomar Conference Center. Eco-Farm is the premier national gathering of farmers, gardeners, and marketers in sustainable agriculture.

Martin's involvement with sustainable agriculture began with his one-year apprenticeship at the UCSC Farm & Garden in 1974-75. He then coordinated the Santa Cruz County Community Gardens program for two years, overseeing 12 gardens and advising more than 400 community gardeners. Since returning to UCSC, he has instructed hundreds of students in the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture program.

In addition to his teaching and gardening responsibilities, Martin regularly offers community lectures and public workshops. His work has inspired countless gardeners, who have gone on to influence others in settings as diverse as schools, community gardens, and international development programs.
