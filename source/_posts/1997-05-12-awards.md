Assistant professor of economics **Menzie Chinn** and his wife, Laura Elise Schwendinger, of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, have been granted concurrent month-long residencies at the Rockefeller Foundation's Study and Conference Center in Bellagio, Italy, in July. Chinn's residency will be used to investigate the interrelationship between increasing economic internationalization, capital flows, and competitiveness. Schwendinger will be composing a set of vocal pieces called "Songs of Heaven and Earth."
