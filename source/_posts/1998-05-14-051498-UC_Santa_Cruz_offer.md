## UC Santa Cruz Offers A Wealth Of Experiences For The Summer Visitor

SANTA CRUZ, CA-As this year's rainy weather trickles away, the public is invited to celebrate the coming of summer by exploring the University of California, Santa Cruz, and some of its larger research facilities. Whether one wants to learn about astronomy or marine mammals or enjoy a stroll through an exotic garden, UCSC offers the opportunity. Admission is free, unless otherwise noted.

Tours of the UC Santa Cruz campus

The Office of Admissions offers tours of the UCSC campus on all weekdays and selected Saturdays throughout the year. The two-hour tour program starts at the Cook House near the campus's main entrance at Bay and High Streets. Reservations are required; call (408) 459-4008.

The Arboretum

Outlandish plants from faraway places are some of the first things visitors will see on a stroll through the colorful shrubs of the Arboretum's South African, Australian, and New Zealand gardens. The warm, still days of late summer are sometimes good for butterfly watching, and hummingbirds abound regardless of the weather. A research and teaching facility, the Arboretum is open year-round from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, except on Thanksgiving and Christmas. "Norrie's"--a gift shop selling plants (some new to the U.S.), cut flowers, wreaths, and books--is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and on Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. The Jean and Bill Lane Horticultural Library, a nonlending library of horticultural and botanical books, is open Wednesday through Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. The Arboretum is located on Empire Grade between the campus's main and west entrances. For information, call (408) 427-2998. For the gift shop, call (408) 423-4977.

Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems

Have you visited UCSC's organic Farm and historic Garden? The 25-acre Farm near the campus's main entrance and the two-acre Alan Chadwick Garden across McLaughlin Drive from Stevenson College are both open to the public daily. On the Farm's docent-led tours, visitors can learn about many aspects of organic gardening, including how to make and use compost and select plants that attract beneficial insects. Tours of the Farm start at the Farm's entrance gate at noon on Thursday and 2 p.m. on Sunday. Tours are canceled in the event of rain. The Farm and the Chadwick Garden are open every day from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. during the summer. Starting in mid-June and continuing through late October, the Center for Agroecology sells organically grown produce and fresh flowers each Tuesday and Friday from noon to 6 p.m. in front of the Barn Theater at the intersection of Bay and High Streets. The center also sponsors classes and events through the summer and fall. For more information, call (408) 459-3240. To arrange special tours and class visits, call (408) 459-3248.

Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory

Visitors are invited to open a "window of discovery" into the science of oceans and marine life at this working marine research laboratory on the bluffs above the Monterey Bay. Children and adults alike may hold a living sea star in the laboratory's touch pool, view a skeleton of a blue whale, and gaze at gauzy moon jellies in the aquarium. Trained docents answer questions and lead tours Tuesday through Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. year-round, except on holidays. Tours include a visit to the laboratory's marine mammal research pools, and special children's activities are offered during summer. Admission is $2 for adults, $1 for senior citizens and students, and free for children ages 16 and under. On the first Tuesday of every month, admission is free for everyone. Prearranged group tours and school programs are available on midweek mornings. The laboratory is located at the west end of Delaware Avenue in Santa Cruz. For more information, call (408) 459-4308.

A working observatory, Lick is located atop Mount Hamilton, 19 miles east of San Jose and about 60 miles from campus. Tours of the 36-inch refracting Lick Telescope start in the visitors' center in the main building every half hour between 1 and 4:30 p.m. on weekdays and from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on weekends. The visitors' center is open from 12:30 to 5 p.m. weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends. The visitors' gallery, which houses the 120-inch Shane Telescope, is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Both buildings are closed for Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day.
