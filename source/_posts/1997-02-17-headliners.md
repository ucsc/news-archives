Chemist **Joe Konopelsk**i basked in his 15 minutes in the spotlight, and much more, for attempts in his lab to synthesize a potential cancer-fighting compound from a marine animal that divers can no longer find. The _San Francisco Chronicle_ carried the story first, followed by an Associated Press article and photo that hit the front pages of papers across the country.

The _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ paid page-one attention to UCSC's connections to last week's launch of the space shuttle _Discovery,_ sent skyward to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope. The article featured alumnus **Steve Hawley,** one of seven astronauts aboard, and astronomer **Harland Epps,** who helped design one of Hubble's new instruments.
