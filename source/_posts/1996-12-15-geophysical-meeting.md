**New way to gauge ages of stalactites may yield precise climate-change tool**

Sunday, December 15, 2:45 p.m. Session OS72D, talk #6 Moscone Center, room 306

Speakers: Craig Lundstrom (408/459-4089 or cclund@bagnold.ucsc.edu) and Peter Holden (408/459-5559 or pholden@rupture.ucsc.edu)

The slow but relentless drippings of calcium-rich water in  caves may open a new window on earth's past climate, thanks to a  precise dating technique under development at UC Santa Cruz.

Preserved within the stark beauty of stalactites and  stalagmites are two records of changes in the climate of the outside  world. One such record is purely physical: When more water oozes  from the roof of a cave, the rocky icicles grow faster. If researchers  find similar growth spurts in caves over a wide region, they can  infer that more rain fell during that period.

The second record relies on a well-known chemical  phenomenon. As global temperatures warm up or cool down, and as  precipitation patterns change, the ratio of "heavy" to "light" isotopes  in rain or snow (defined by the weights of oxygen atoms in water  molecules) changes in different regions. For instance, glaciers may  lock up more light water, leaving heavier water in the sea.  Paleoclimatologists can unmask past temperature fluctuations by  detecting these subtle shifts in old layers of ice and in ocean  sediments. The mineralized water that makes a stalactite also  carries those clues, frozen in as the calcite deposit slowly  lengthens.

It's no simple matter to retrieve those records in a useful way.  Scientists must know when changes occurred in the growth rate or  chemistry of a particular stalactite, but resolving those dates has  proven devilishly difficult. The objects grow perhaps an inch every  thousand years, making the sample sizes small. Further, traditional  techniques for dating ancient geologic samples aren't precise enough  to yield accurate ages for layers deposited within the last few  thousand years.

That's the value of work by UCSC research specialist Peter  Holden, postdoctoral researcher Craig Lundstrom, and undergraduate  Andy Jacobson. The team adapted a technique used to date volcanic  rocks with high precision. The method uses the radioactive decay of  uranium, which stops at several elemental stations on its train ride  of decay to lead. Two of those elements are thorium, which has a  half-life of 75,000 years, and protactinium, with a half-life of  33,000 years. Others have used uranium-thorium analysis to try to  measure the ages of cave deposits, but the addition of protactinium  makes the technique much more sensitive.

The researchers analyzed a 10-inch stalactite that had fallen  from the roof of a cave on California's central coast. They measured  ages ranging from 8,500 years at the top of the stalactite to less  than 800 years near its tip. The scientists estimate their technique  is accurate to within 1 percent for the older end of the stalactite-- corresponding to a time window of about 80 years.

Paleoclimatologist James Zachos of UCSC hopes his group will  be able to apply the method to resolve the frequency of terrestrial  climate changes during the last 20,000 years on timescales ranging  from decades to millennia. For example, cave deposits in the  western U.S. and Mexico may reveal the broad effects of El Nino  events on regional temperatures and precipitation.

**Improved techniques needed for accurate measurements of trace metals in groundwater**

Tuesday, December 17, 2:40 p.m. Session H22D, talk #5 Moscone Center, room 306

Speaker: Carol Creasey (408) 459-2088 or ccreasey@earthsci.ucsc.edu

Standard techniques for measuring metals in groundwater may  drastically overestimate their levels, forcing owners of supposedly  contaminated sites to "remediate" problems that may not exist.

Graduate student Carol Creasey and professor of earth  sciences Russell Flegal, both of UC Santa Cruz, studied the  groundwater from two wells at a reportedly contaminated site in  central California. A consulting company also monitored the wells  for trace-metal contamination using standard sampling and  analytical techniques. The differences were striking: The  concentrations of trace metals detected by the UCSC scientists  ranged from 2 to 1,000 times lower than those reported by the  consultants. In particular, the consultants claimed that the levels of  cadmium and chromium in the groundwater exceeded the state's  clean-water guidelines, whereas the UCSC tests revealed no such  infractions.

Two key factors accounted for those discrepancies. First, the  UCSC team used "low-flow" techniques to purge stagnant water from  the wells and collect their samples, extracting less than one liter of  water per minute. Pumping more quickly than that, Creasey says, can  generate groundwater that is not representative of the natural  system.

Second, Creasey and Flegal used rigorous "trace-metal clean"  techniques at the site and during their laboratory analysis. These  techniques prevent inadvertent contamination by ensuring that all  materials touching the groundwater are thoroughly cleaned with  acids and isolated from metallic objects or dusts. Also important,  says Creasey, is to have more than one person assist with the water  sampling so that samples are not contaminated.

Analysis of seven metals in the samples at UCSC showed that  none of the concentrations exceeded federal or state standards,  except for nickel in the most heavily impacted well. However, the  consultants--who monitored the wells both five months before and  one month after the UCSC team--found that levels of nickel,  cadmium, and chromium violated the standards in one or both of the  wells. For example, the consultants measured 51.4 parts per billion  of chromium in one well (compared to a state maximum of 50 ppb),  but the UCSC researchers detected just 0.0734 ppb, a 700-fold  difference.

Creasey and Flegal acknowledge that not all consultants will  have access to the precise analytical tools found in their UCSC lab.  However, low-flow and trace-metal clean techniques are feasible  for everyone, they say. Further, those techniques would raise  sampling and analytical costs only moderately.

"Consultants should try these methods to see whether they  make a difference," Creasey says. "Extensive monitoring and  remediation of a site that may not be contaminated is certainly  more costly than conducting the measurements right the first time  with more careful techniques."

**Roots of "hot spots" may extend to earth's core-mantle boundary**

Tuesday, December 17, 3:20 and 4:25 p.m. Session T22E, talks #6 and #10 Moscone Center, room 307

Speakers: Edward Garnero (408/459-5139 or eddie@rupture.ucsc.edu) and Quentin Williams (408/459-3132 or quentw@rupture.ucsc.edu)

"Hot spots," the isolated patches of volcanism unrelated to  plate tectonics, may spring from surprisingly deep within the planet:  the turbulent boundary between earth's mantle and its core.

That conclusion, sure to put scientists on the spot at the AGU  meeting, has arisen from intense study of a layer at the base of the  mantle that apparently contains partially molten rock. Researchers  at UC Santa Cruz and elsewhere analyzed a peculiar type of seismic  wave that skims along the mantle side of the sharp core-mantle  boundary. In several regions, something bogs down the speed of the  waves by about 10 percent--a huge amount by geophysical standards.  The most likely cause, the researchers maintain, is that a small  fraction of melted material bathes the mantle rock and transforms  it into a thick mush.

Seismologist Edward Garnero of UCSC has worked with Donald  Helmberger of Caltech and UCSC's Justin Revenaugh to characterize  the layer. So far, the seismologists have probed about 45 percent of  the core-mantle boundary in search of the partial melt. Temperature  constraints at the boundary would require that if the layer exists  anywhere, it would encircle the globe. However, the layer appears  substantially thicker in some regions--most notably under the  south-central Pacific, Iceland, East Africa, and the Azores. The  seismic evidence thus far points to a layer of partial melt no thicker  than about 20 kilometers in those zones. Elsewhere, it would be  much thinner--5 kilometers or less--and would evade seismic  detection entirely.

These first few swaths of partial melt, notes UCSC mineral  physicist Quentin Williams, lie 2,900 kilometers beneath some of  the most well-known hot spots on the planet. That correlation is not  yet perfect, but it is no coincidence, he believes. "This may be the  smoking gun that hot spots originate from the core-mantle  boundary," Williams says. Although others have proposed such a deep  genesis for hot spots, no one has yet unveiled solid evidence to  support that theory.

Williams envisions a partially molten layer that becomes  unstable at irregular intervals above the core-mantle boundary,  welling up into thicker, stubby plumes. These zones would help heat  flow with great dispatch out of the liquid outer core and into the  lower mantle. "This may be the first image we have of a process that  spans the mantle," Williams says. "Feeder zones of plumes that start  at the base of the mantle would rise all the way to the surface and  create hot spots."

This line of reasoning has several fascinating implications. For  instance, if there is indeed a partially molten layer at the base of  the mantle, it would be about a trillion times less viscous than the  solid mantle immediately above. "That's geodynamically very  interesting," Williams observes. Further, the scenario raises a  "chicken and egg" conundrum: Would upwellings in the partially  molten layer trigger and sustain the hot spots, or would hot spots  draw material up through the mantle and cause the upwellings? Stay tuned as the debate heats up.

**Recent quakes don't appear to violate seismic gap hypothesis**

Thursday, December 19, 8:30 a.m.-noon Session S41A, poster #16 Moscone Center, Hall D

Presenter: Susan Schwartz (408) 459-3133 or sschwartz@earthsci.ucsc.edu

The seismic gap hypothesis of earthquake recurrence,  threatened by four large and seemingly "premature" quakes in the  last two years, appears under closer scrutiny to remain valid.

The hypothesis maintains that once an earthquake ruptures a  fault, the same region will not rupture again until enough time  passes--usually many decades or centuries--for stress to rebuild.  Researchers have used this hypothesis to look for "gaps" in fault  zones that have a previous history of earthquakes but have not  ruptured recently, and to identify those gaps as the most likely sites  for quakes in the near future. This notion is commonly applied around  the Pacific Rim, where most of the world's great earthquakes occur.

However, four events in the last two years seemed to cast  doubt on this approach. In each case, quakes slightly smaller than  magnitude 8 struck in areas where even larger earthquakes had  occurred within the last 10 to 30 years. That's not nearly enough  time in most cases, seismologists believe, for such levels of stress  to reaccumulate in a fault zone.

Susan Schwartz, director of the W. M. Keck Seismological  Laboratory at UC Santa Cruz, decided to take a closer look at the  details of each set of earthquakes. Since the early 1960s, global  seismic records have allowed researchers to reconstruct how a  quake occurs--where the earth slips along the fault and how that  slip is distributed. "We've found that earthquake slip along a fault  can vary dramatically," Schwartz says. "Some regions of the fault  zone move a lot, while others may not move much at all, even if  they're nearby."

In three of the four cases, Schwartz found, the recent quakes  broke sections of the faults that had moved little in the original  events. Those quake pairs were in the Kuril Islands north of Japan (M 8.5 in 1963, M 7.9 in 1995); the Solomon Islands east of New  Guinea (M 8.0 in 1971, M 7.8 in 1995); and northern Honshu in Japan  (M 8.2 in 1968, M 7.7 in 1994). "These are all nice examples of  subsequent earthquakes filling in the gaps," Schwartz says. "They  are not repeat events, even though the epicenters are close together  and the aftershock zones have some overlap."

The fourth set of earthquakes, in the central Aleutian Islands,  is harder to unravel. There, a M 8.6 quake in 1957 was followed by a  M 8.2 in 1986 and a M 7.9 in 1996. The slip distribution for the 1957  quake is difficult to determine, Schwartz says, because it predated  the global seismic network. At the very least, it appears that the  1986 and 1996 rupture zones were markedly different.

"The physical concept behind the seismic gap hypothesis is  still correct," Schwartz says. "If an area slips in an earthquake, the  same area should not slip again in the near future. But because the  slip is not uniform over the whole rupture area, there is no  'characteristic' earthquake to identify from one cycle to the next."  The need to tease out such levels of detail about each rupture, she  says, may make it difficult for seismologists to apply the seismic  gap hypothesis in a meaningful way.

**Fluids flow fleetly under the seafloor**

Thursday, December 19, 1:35 p.m. Session T42C, talk #1 Moscone Center, room 130

Speaker: Andrew Fisher (408) 459-5598 or afisher@earthsci.ucsc.edu

Hydrogeologists have taken the closest look yet at the  intricate cycle of fluids that flow relentlessly beneath the seafloor.  That flow, it now appears, is far more forceful than expected.

Driven by the heat of the planet's interior, water courses  through pores and cracks under the ocean in earth's upper crust. The  water leaches minerals as it flows, altering the crust and suffusing  the ocean with important elements. This process occurs  dramatically at "black smokers" and other hot vents along volcanic  midocean ridges. It happens to a far greater extent along the  sweeping flanks of these ridges, and possibly under most of the rest  of the ocean as well. But because the seafloor is so remote,  scientists have known precious little about the details.

That all changed during Leg 168 of the Ocean Drilling Program,  a two-month cruise in July and August off the Pacific Northwest. An  international team of researchers, led by cochief scientists Andrew  Fisher of UC Santa Cruz and Earl Davis of the Geological Survey of  Canada, drilled as far as 1,900 feet into the seafloor on the flanks  of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, where the planet churns out fresh slabs of  oceanic crust.

The researchers collected the first known samples of pristine  "basement" water--fluids trapped under the seafloor for many  thousands of years. Chemical analysis of these and other samples  points to a surprisingly energetic cycling of fluids and heat beneath  the sediments that shroud the young crust.

"There's no question the water is moving much faster than we  thought," Fisher says. The time it takes for the entire volume of the  world's oceans to cycle through these subseafloor systems, he notes,  could be "much, much shorter" than the previous estimate of one to  two million years.

Fisher and his colleagues found that the upper oceanic crust  beneath seafloor ridges is "overpressured," meaning that hot water  surged from their drill holes. Tests also showed that the crust is  most conducive to fluid flow within layers that are perhaps just 10  meters thick. "We're still hard-pressed to explain how these fluids  can travel laterally within the crust for 50 to 80 kilometers, but the  thermal and chemical data suggest this is exactly what happens,"  Fisher says.

Cochief scientist Davis adds: "We've come to realize that this  kind of water circulation is much more important than we believed  just a few years ago. We suspect these processes take place within  a large part of the seafloor, perhaps most of it, and play important  roles in forming mineral deposits and in helping to control the  composition of seawater."

The Leg 168 scientists installed deep-sea observatories,  called CORKs, in four of the drill holes. The CORKS will record the  pressures and temperatures of fluids with exquisite sensitivity for  several years; manned or robotic vessels will retrieve the data.  Fisher and Davis expect the results will help paint a complete  picture of the forces that impel the fluids.
