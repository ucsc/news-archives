Plenty of donation barrels and two peanut-butter-and-jam lunches will be part of this year's Second Harvest Food Bank Holiday Food Drive.

Last Friday, volunteers from Sigma Omicron Pi and Alpha Kappa Delta Phi sororities and the Delta Omega Chi and Pi Alpha Phi fraternities left donation barrels at the colleges and in public areas such as the McHenry Library foyer and the Cowell Student Health Center lobby. They will pick up the barrels and the donations they contain the week of December 16.

On Wednesday, December 2, and Thursday, December 3, volunteers will disburse peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches and milk to students, faculty, and staff who donate whatever amount of money they would normally spend on lunch.

The sandwiches will be distributed from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at College Eight, Crown College, Social Sciences 1 and 2, McHenry Library, the Cowell Student Health Center, between Stevenson and Cowell Colleges, and in the patio area of Science Hill.

The food bank has set a goal to collect 200,000 pounds of food this year, nearly 15,700 pounds more than last year.

Second Harvest accepts donations in the form of checks as well as nonperishable food. The food bank can buy $13.42 worth of canned goods with each dollar donated, said Teri Pelton of the Public Information Office, who is coordinating the drive for UCSC.

A community nonprofit organization, Second Harvest distributes the donations it receives to needy people throughout the year--through soup kitchens, shelters, and emergency pantries in Santa Cruz and San Benito Counties.
