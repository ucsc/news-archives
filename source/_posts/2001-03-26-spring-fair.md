SANTA CRUZ--Current and prospective students, their families, and alumni are invited to campus on Saturday, April 21, for UCSC's annual Banana Slug Spring Fair.

An array of special events, including reunions for alumni and academic information fairs for prospective students, a student block party, dance performance, tours, and a nature walk, are on the schedule.

Tours of UCSC's colleges get under way at 10 a.m. and continue until 3 p.m. Each college will host a reception for alumni, faculty, and current and prospective students from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. There is also an open house at the Women's Center from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Alumni will have a chance to reconnect with friends from the past at the Alumni Associations All-Alumni Reunion Luncheon, from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Porter College Dining Hall. Two colleges--Kresge and Stevenson--will also hold reunions. Kresge College will celebrate its 30th anniversary throughout the weekend; Stevenson College will mark its 35th year with a day of festivities on April 21.

There will also be reunions sponsored by the Economics Department and Community Studies Department, as well as events organized by alumni affinity groups such the Latino Alumni Network and Black Escargot, an African American group.   
Visitors will sample UCSC's cultural offerings with a performance of "Santa Cruz Dance," featuring the works of choreographers Tandy Beal, Mel Wong, and Scott Wells, at 8 p.m, April 20-21, at UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage. A different repertoire will be featured each night. Call the Ticket Office at (831) 459-2159.
