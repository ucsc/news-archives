Teams of mostly staff members from all across campus walked, jogged, and ran around the East Field Track last week as part of the 12th annual Prediction Walk/Run. Nearly 330 people in 82 teams vied for prizes in the event, which took place Thursday, May 20.

Prizes went not to the fastest teams, but to those who had most accurately predicted how long it would take their team to walk or run a relay race on the half-mile track.

"It's not who is fastest but who's most accurate that's important," said Dan Wood, director of the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports (OPERS). "The message we're trying to deliver with this event is you don't have to kill yourself to be fit. Just start easy and stick with it."

Prizes offered at the event included OPERS recreation cards, sailing lessons, track bags, and a luncheon at Ristorante Avante. All participants received a free t-shirt and enjoyed fruit, muffins, and beverages.

* **First place** went to the "Club Media Services" team, made up of Matt Norwood, Jan Dickens, and Jeff Wagner. The team's relay lasted one second longer than their predicted time of 32 minutes.
* **Second place** was "Late Eight," with Imelda Lopez, Baldo Zaragoza, Estela Alvarez, and Silas Snyder. The team was two seconds over their predicted time of 28 minutes, 32 seconds.
* **Third place** went to "Hormones of Love," with Ignacio Camarillo, Ann Wohlhueter, Meghan McCarty, and Rick Shea. The team was four seconds over their predicted time of 14 minutes, 40 seconds.

The event was sponsored by OPERS, with prizes, refreshments, and additional support provided by the Office of the Assistant Chancellor for Human Resources, Staff Human Resources, and the Bay Tree Bookstore.
