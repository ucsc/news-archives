SANTA CRUZ, CA--Succulents and basils are at the top of the list of new offerings that will be available at the annual UC Santa Cruz Farm & Garden spring plant sale on Saturday and Sunday, May 1 and 2. Hours are 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. each day in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High Streets at the base of campus.

Succulents require little care and make an attractive addition to rock gardens, flower borders, and even as ground covers. More than 25 succulent species will be available for purchase, including medicinal Aloe vera. In addition, a wide variety of specialty basils will be for sale, including scented basils such as lemon, cinnamon, and anise, as well as the familiar large-leaved sweet basil.

The plant sale features a wide selection of organically raised plants, including more than 200 species of vegetables, flowers, landscape plants, herbs, and "everlastings," or dried flowers. All plants are proven to grow well in the local area.

Among the lovely perennials that will be available are columbine, coral bells, statice, Japanese anemone, blue globe thistle, and cupid's dart. The flower selection will include a wide variety of lavenders, salvias, sunflowers, yarrows, zinnias, alstroemeria, roses, and penstemons.

This year's vegetable selection includes six-packs of salad mix, lettuces, sweet and hot peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, Asian greens, and an array of tomatoes, including Early Girl, Camp Joy cherry, Orange Sungold, Crimson, Carmello, Pink Brandywine, and Dona.

Medicinal herbs will also be available, including echinacea, feverfew, St. John's wort, skullcap, and valerian. In addition to the new basils, the selection of culinary herbs will include lemon verbena, pineapple sage, French tarragon, rosemary, and several varieties of mint, sage, thyme, and oregano.

Sponsored by the Friends of the Farm & Garden and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, the sale will benefit the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture. Members of the Friends will receive a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available at the sale. For more information, call (831) 459-3240.
