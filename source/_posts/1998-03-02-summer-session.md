Registration begins today for UCSC Summer Session's 1998 courses, which cover a wide range of academic subjects, from cell and molecular biology to video documentary production.

This summer's offerings also include an intensive language institute and a live-in academic program for high school students.

UCSC's Summer Session is divided into two five-week course blocks, with a few four-, seven-, and ten-week courses falling outside those two main sessions.

Important dates to remember are:
* June 29: Classes start for Session 1
* August 3: Classes start for Session 2
