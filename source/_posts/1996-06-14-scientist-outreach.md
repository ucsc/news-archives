title: UC Santa Cruz Scientists Reach High School Students And The Public Via The Internet

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California, Santa Cruz, may sit  in an isolated hillside forest, but scientists have reached out beyond  their campus to schools across the country. Using the Internet,  faculty from several scientific fields have shared their expertise  with schoolteachers and their classes nationwide, as well as with  the local community.

UCSC has a long history of working with local schools to  improve science education. Faculty and graduate students loan  equipment for class experiments, visit classes, and lead field trips  to areas of interest such as Natural Bridges State Beach or local  tide pools. Now, with the World Wide Web becoming so prevalent,  faculty are able to help students outside the local area. "I think the  Internet is a good way for students to get access to experts," says  Stanley Flatte, a UCSC professor of physics.

One such Internet interaction involved members of the UCSC  Physics Department. This spring, a physics class from a small high  school in the cornfields of north-central Illinois contacted the  department for help with an assignment. Gerald Castelli, physics  teacher at Serena High School, asked his students to use the World  Wide Web to answer an assigned question. "I tried to find a question  that would be hard to answer from a book," says Castelli. The  students were to write a report about why Isaac Newton's 300-year- old classical theories of physics were emphasized in physics  classes over Albert Einstein's more modern relativity theories.

Castelli's students browsed the Web in search of answers and  came across the UCSC Physics Department's Web page. "At random  we took a shot and sent some e-mail," says Castelli. "The next day  we had eight or nine responses. I was impressed by the speed and  number of responses we got." The students sent follow-up questions  to members of the faculty and wrote their reports based on these  responses. "The Web was a great way to find experts," says Brian  Scheppler, a senior in Castelli's class.

Flatte and physicists Joel Primack, Michael Dine, David  Belanger, Bruce Schumm, Peter Scott, and Robert Johnson all sent  answers to the students. The scientists replied independently, but  they came up with similar answers. They agreed that Newtonian  physics is accurate for events people encounter in their everyday  lives, such as walking, throwing balls, or flying in planes. It only  goes awry in specific circumstances of high energy or velocity.  Although Newtonian physics falls short of describing all situations,  the researchers commented, it is easier to learn than Einstein's  theories and provides a strong foundation for further studies in  physics. "Later on, I hope you and your fellow students also learn  about relativity and quantum physics, even through we do not know  their full range of validity," wrote Primack in his response.

The Physics Department is not alone in using the Internet to  work with high schools. Robert Anderson, an associate professor of  earth sciences, worked with teacher Nancy White and her class at C.  D. Hylton Senior High School in Woodbridge, Virginia, on a project  about the motions of windblown sand, a topic in which Anderson  specializes.

"We had considerable e-mail banter, first just between the  two of us, followed by specific--and rather demanding I might add-- questions from the students," says Anderson. "They got all jazzed up  and ended up winning an award for their work." Indeed, the students  won first place in SuperQuest 1994, a national math and science  competition in which high school students use supercomputers to  tackle complex problems.

Anderson met White when she was at a meeting in San  Francisco. "It was wonderful to meet her," he says. "She had done so  much for those kids."

While neither Anderson nor the Physics Department solicited  student inquiries, the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department  encourages people to write via e-mail with questions. The  department's Web page includes a section called "Ask an  Astronomer" (<http://www.ucolick.org/~mountain/AAA>). Included in  this page are answers to frequently asked questions about  astronomy, as well as a way for people to submit their own  inquiries. These can range from questions about what it's like to be  an astronomer to specific requests about comets or asteroids that  are visible. Postings come from local students and their parents, as  well as from Silicon Valley engineers and amateur astronomers  across the country.

"I have been surprised at how sophisticated the questions are,"  says Debra Fischer, one of three graduate students who take turns  answering questions. "Sometimes students will write back telling us  they got an 'A' on their paper and thanking us for our help."
