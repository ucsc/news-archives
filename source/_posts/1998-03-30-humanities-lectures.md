author: Barbara McKenna
---

UCSC's Creative Writing Program has grown in recent years to become the nucleus of a talented and increasingly acclaimed cluster of poets and novelists. Four core faculty in the program, all of whom have published new work in the past year, will come together for the first time for a special evening of poetry and fiction readings on Thursday, April 9.

This literary quartet is a presentation of the Humanities Lecture Series, sponsored jointly by UCSC's Humanities Division and the Museum of Art and History. It takes place from 7 to 8 p.m. at the Museum of Art and History at the McPherson Center, 705 Front St., Santa Cruz. The reading is free and open to the public. A reception follows.

The faculty who will read from their works are:

**Peter Gizzi:**

One of the country's most celebrated young poets, Gizzi has received a number of awards, including the prestigious Lavan Younger Poets Award in 1994\. Gizzi's second collection of poetry, _Artificial Heart_, was released in March--the first of three due out this spring. The others are _The House that Jack Built: The Collected Lectures of Jack Spicer_ and _An Anthology of New (American) Poets_, which includes a section on Gizzi. Among his other publications are _Periplum_ (1992) and the chapbooks, _Hours of the Book_ (1994) and _Music for Films_ (1992). Previous editing projects include _o-blek: a journal of language arts_ (1987-93) and the international literary anthology _Exact Change Yearbook_ (1995). Gizzi teaches creative writing and literature at UCSC.    

** [Nathaniel Mackey][7]**

Poet and novelist Nathaniel Mackey has authored nearly a dozen books and monographs and is the recipient of a 1993 Whiting Writers' Award. His interest in jazz and African culture informs his critically acclaimed work. His publications include _Whatsaid Serif_ (his third book of poems, due out later this spring); _Song of the Andoumboulou 18-20_ (1994); _School of Udhra_ (1993); _Djbot Baghostus's Run_ (1993); _Bedouin Hornbook_ (1986); _Eroding Witness_ (1985); and _Discrepant Engagement: Dissonance, Cross-Culturality, and Experimental Writing_ (1993). His compact disc recording _Strick: Song of the Andoumboulou 16-25_ (1995) presents him reading his work accompanied by musicians Royal Hartigan and Hafez Modirzadeh. Mackey edits the literary journal _Hambone_ and is coeditor of _Moment's Notice: Jazz in Poetry and Prose_ (1993). He teaches creative writing and African American, contemporary, and experimental literature at UCSC.
