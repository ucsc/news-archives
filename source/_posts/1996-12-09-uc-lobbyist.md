Chancellor Greenwood hosted the University of California's chief legislative advocate at UCSC last week as part of a campaign to gain stronger support for the campus's interests in Sacramento.

In the meeting with Arditti, the chancellor and others on campus described plans for expanding UCSC's engineering programs; collaborations with educational, agricultural, and research-oriented institutions and others; progress on the Monterey Bay Education, Science, and Technology Center and the Long Marine Lab Visitor Education Center; and the service provided by UCSC Extension to the Silicon Valley.

Also discussed were student fee increases, the growing need for financial aid, and the impact of the passage of Proposition 209.

Following the meeting, Dean Ed Houghton escorted Arditti through the new Music Center.

The purpose of the visit was to give the university's advocates current information about the campus, says Director of Public Information Elizabeth M. Irwin, who is also assistant to the chancellor for communications with governmental constituencies. "We expect visits such as this one will result in stronger  advocacy for the campus's interests in Sacramento," she says.
