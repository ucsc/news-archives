SANTA CRUZ, CA--The National Science Foundation announced on  March 28 that it will negotiate a five-year agreement with the  University of California, San Diego, to revolutionize high-performance computing resources for the nation's scientists  and engineers. UC Santa Cruz is one of 37 institutions that will  contribute to the program, called the National Partnership for  Advanced Computational Infrastructure (NPACI).

New supercomputing capabilities will help researchers tackle  currently intractable problems, such as targeted drug development,  the design of new materials with specific characteristics, and  detailed weather prediction. Such advances will become feasible as  NPACI researchers create a national "metacomputing" environment,  linking large numbers of powerful computers, data archives, and  visualization systems via ultra-high-speed networks. The system  ultimately will analyze multiple collections of data containing more  than one trillion bytes of information.

The UC San Diego partnership is one of two winning recipients  in a competition to replace the country's existing network of four  university-based supercomputing centers. The other partnership, led  by the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, is the National  Computational Science Alliance (NCSA). Funding for the two new  partnerships will begin on October 1.

"NPACI has assembled the most knowledgeable people in  computational and computer science," said Sidney Karin, director of  NPACI and founding director of the San Diego Supercomputer Center.  "Together with NCSA, we will build a coordinated, national  infrastructure that will provide unprecedented computational  capabilities for the nation's researchers. This is a rare opportunity  to have a profound impact on scientific progress."

Of roughly $150 million in funds over a five-year period for  the UC San Diego consortium, UC Santa Cruz will receive about  $830,000. UCSC's funding will enhance research programs in physics,  computer engineering, and computer science. New programmers will  help to create and manage large databases in ocean acoustics,  atmospheric turbulence, and oceanographic and meteorologic  information from the Monterey Bay Area.

"These programmers will engage in networked, interactive  collaborations with researchers at the San Diego Supercomputer  Center, Caltech, UCLA, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"  said Stanley Flatte, professor of physics and principal investigator  for UCSC's participation in NPACI. "The emphasis will be on  developing new computing capabilities for working with massive  databases, especially for researchers who are distributed across the  country."

Flatte's research group studies how waves behave as they  move through complex and constantly shifting media, such as the  ocean and the atmosphere. For example, researchers use sounds to  probe small-scale and large-scale processes in the sea; changes in  the speed at which sound travels across the ocean could provide  evidence of global warming. Light traveling through a turbulent  atmosphere affects astronomical observations, and also may be used  as a remote-sensing probe for weather and climate models. Through  NPACI, Flatte hopes to expand his caches of data in these areas and  speed the pace of collaborative research with scientists elsewhere.

Three UCSC computer scientists are coprincipal investigators:  associate dean and Jack Baskin Professor of Computer Engineering  Patrick Mantey, Associate Professor Darrell Long, and Assistant  Professor Alex Pang. NPACI funding will help them create the next  generation of an innovative project called REINAS--the Real-time  Environmental Information Network and Analysis System. Begun in  1992, the REINAS project gathers data on the Monterey Bay coastal  environment from an extensive network of remote sensors, stores it  in a distributed database, and displays data on command via  powerful graphics techniques. Mantey and his colleagues now seek to  expand the REINAS model to other environmental systems and to  make its vast database available to a widely distributed network of  researchers.

The University of California system will contribute to NPACI  by providing high-speed fiber optics data transmission lines for the  faculty members and programmers involved. The Santa Cruz campus  also will provide significant "in-kind" support for the program in the  form of dedicated workstations and other hardware, as well as the  time of researchers.

Other northern California partners in NPACI are UC Berkeley,  UC Davis, UC San Francisco, Stanford, Lawrence Berkeley National  Laboratory, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
