title: Public Health Depends On Strict Environmental Regulations, Says UCSC Professor Who Will Deliver Free Public Lecture On October 26

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Contrary to those who complain that stringent  environmental regulations place an unfair burden on business, Ronnie  Lipschutz, an assistant professor of politics at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, says tough environmental standards make a  key contribution to public health.

Lipschutz will discuss the relationship of environmental  protection to community health on Thursday, October 26, in a talk  titled "Healthy Environment, Healthy Community: Promoting  Community Health in California Through Effective Environmental  Protection, Regulation, and Education." The hour-long talk, which is  open to the public, will begin at 7 p.m. in room 150 at Stevenson  College on the UCSC campus. Admission is free. A reception will  follow in the Stevenson Fireside Lounge. The talk is part of the 1995  Wellness Lecture Series, sponsored by the California Wellness  Foundation and the University of California.

"A clean environment reduces medical costs," says Lipschutz.  "It's not simply an amenity or an economic or regulatory burden."  Among the health risks of environmental degradation are respiratory  ailments, cancers, birth defects, low birth weights, cataracts, and  other illnesses.

Critics of environmental regulations are quick to cite the cost  of efforts to control pollution, radiation, toxic chemicals, hazardous  wastes, and other threats--estimates range from $88 billion to  $300 billion a year nationwide. Equally important but rarely studied,  says Lipschutz, are the health benefits of environmental protection.  Such benefits are difficult to calculate, says Lipschutz, but one  study in the mid-1980s estimated that although the cost of air  pollution control efforts in California would reach $3 billion a year  by 1987, the health benefits would add up to $4 billion annually.

The former Soviet Bloc stands as a chilling example of the  human cost of environmental damage, says Lipschutz. Studies reveal  that the incidence of various environmentally linked illnesses is on  the rise and that life expectancies are falling. Researchers blame  the disturbing trends on the declining delivery of health services,  high levels of pollutants in the air, water, and elsewhere, and  ecological damage from obsolescent and unregulated industries and  other facilities.

"You look at places like Russia that don't have the  environmental regulations we do, and you can see that the costs are  very high," says Lipschutz. "It's easier to calculate what we're  spending on environmental protection than it is to calculate what  costs we'd bear if we weren't taking those precautions. I don't think  the benefits are quantifiable in the same dollars-and-cents way. It  becomes a question of the value of human life, and, ultimately, what  are society's values. Do we value collective health, or do we say that  people who are exposed to environmental hazards can always move  away?"

Lipschutz proposes a new model of community health  monitoring that would involve neighborhoods, schools, and public  health agencies. "Communities need to act together in a much more  concerted way to ensure the environmental quality of where they  live," says Lipschutz, who envisions a network of residents  monitoring such factors as air and water quality. Local schools,  community colleges, and universities could be tapped to analyze  samples and review records for indications of problems. If any such  "hot spots" were detected, the records would provide valuable  information for public health authorities at minimal expense, says  Lipschutz, noting that an extensive community-based water-quality  monitoring effort is already under way in Eastern Europe.

Such a system would benefit many communities, especially  poor and minority neighborhoods that typically get little attention  despite the likelihood that they face the highest health risk from  environmental exposure, says Lipschutz.

"We tend to think that environmental protection is a  government function that serves the public good," says Lipschutz.  "The problem is that we can't always rely on government to provide  us with the necessary amount of public good. It's important that  communities play an active role in ensuring environmental quality."

Lipschutz's talk is one of six lectures to be delivered by UC  faculty members during this year's Wellness Lecture Series. The  California Wellness Foundation is an independent private foundation  created in 1992 by an endowment from Health Net, the state's  second-largest health maintenance organization, to improve the  health of Californians.

In addition to the lecture, Lipschutz will participate in a  forum with statewide policy makers later this year.
