Professor of earth sciences **Casey Moore** is being honored as a distinguished alumnus by the Department of Geological Sciences at UC Santa Barbara. Moore received his B.A. in geology from UCSB in 1968. Each year the department honors two of its alumni--one from industry and one from academia--celebrating their accomplishments and providing current students with exemplary role models. Moore will receive the award at a ceremony in June.

In October, associate professor of theater arts **Mark Franko** presented an evening-length work, _Histories of Water,_ with his dance company NovAntiqua at ODC Theatre in San Francisco with support from the Zellerbach Family Fund, the Harkness Foundation on Dance, and UCSC's Arts Division. _Histories of Water_ was also performed at Space Place in New York, at UC Berkeley, and at UCSC. The work was praised by _Bay Guardian_ dance critic Rita Felciano, who wrote, "The transparency and fluency of the historical layers with which Franko was working were fascinating."

In February, Franko directed and choreographed _Fete at Fontainebleau,_ a fanciful reconstruction of a 16th-century court ballet. The piece was performed at UC Berkeley's International House in collaboration with UCB's Music Department. This spring, Franko was one of the principal choreographers for the UCSC dance concert, _Millennium Moves._ Also choreographing were professor of theater arts **Mel Wong,** lecturer in theater arts **Silvia Martins,** and visiting choreographer **Joe Goode.**

UCSC Ombudsman **Sheila K. Gottehrer** gave one of the keynote addresses and participated in an international seminar in Moscow in April, sponsored by and at the invitation of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Moscow State Institute (University) for Foreign Relations (MGIMO). She spoke about "The Role of the University Ombudsman in Establishing a High Level of Legal Consciousness in Relationships Between Members of the University Community." Gottehrer worked with the UNDP, MGIMO and MGIMO's ombudsman to help establish the Ombudsman Program at MGIMO and train their first ombudsman.
