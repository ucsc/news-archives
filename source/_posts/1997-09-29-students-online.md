title: UCSC Brings Student Communications Services Online For 2,000 Students

When Frank Trueba attended college in the late 1970s, he worked on some of  the most rudimentary computers.

"They had no monitor," said Trueba, ResNet and technology systems manager  at Housing, Dining, and Child Care Services. "We had to type something and  then run to the printer to see how it looked."

Now Trueba, in partnership with Communications and Technology Services  (CATS), is helping UCSC provide far more advanced technology to its students.  More than 2,000 students who moved into Merrill, Cowell, Stevenson, and  Crown Colleges, and Crown/Merrill Apartments this fall found in their rooms  new connections to the campus network and the Internet. Students at The  Village, UCSC's new modular housing, will be connected to the network in October.

The students also found active telephone service provided through the  campus's telephone system.

These new connections are part of  Student Communications Services (SCS), a partnership  between Housing, Dining, and Child Care Services, and CATS. The project will  be phased in over two to three years, at the cost of $10.2 million. When  complete, the network will link all residence halls and apartments-- approximately 4,200 bed spaces in 160 buildings--and some public spaces at  the colleges.

SCS is made up of two components: Network Service and Voice Service.

SCS Network Service, dubbed "SlugNet," is a CATS-managed service that  connects students' computers to the campus network and the Internet via  high-speed Ethernet connections over a fiber-optic backbone. The ResNet  organization provides in-room support to students in attaching their  computers to the network and operating them.

SCS Voice Service, which replaces Pacific Bell service, includes active-on-arrival telephone service, optional voice mail, and competitive long-distance  calling through the campus's Ericsson telephone system. In August, UCSC  adopted a second prefix, 502, to serve the new users and changed  the on-campus dialing plan to five digits to support campuswide calling.

"In today's market, where computers are such an integral part of people's  work and personal lives, providing these services is something we need to  do," said Trueba. "The goal of SCS Voice services is to provide better  telephone services than is possible with Pacific Bell at competitive or lower  cost," added Trueba.

Use of the CATS-managed Ericsson system will meet that goal, improve  communications between students and faculty and staff, and make it easier  to provide new SCS services in the future, he said.

As many as 70 percent of the 2,000 students whose rooms were linked to the  fiber-optic network for this fall have personal computers, according to  surveys administered by Housing, Dining, and Child Care Services and CATS.  It's estimated that more than half of those need help connecting to ResNet,  Trueba said.

UCSC has hired 12 "residential computer consultants" to help fellow students  connect to the network and use it effectively. The university plans to hire  approximately 10 more this quarter, Trueba said.

CATS has also set up a Web page to provide information about the system and what students need to use it.

Longtime CATS staffer John Rocchio, newly designated as technical manager  for ResNet, reports that during move-in weekend, more than 220 students  connected to the computer network.

"Judging from the number of questions and calls I've received, people are  very interested in this new service," said Rocchio, who graduated from UCSC  in 1989. "It's exciting. I think it will enable students to communicate in  different ways than they do now."
