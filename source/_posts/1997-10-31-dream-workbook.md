SANTA CRUZ, CAÂ­Judging from the phone calls and letters she has received  since publishing her first book, The Creative Dreamer, Veronica Tonay  appears to be one of those lucky authors whose work is helping people make  positive changes in their lives.

"I've gotten so much feedback from readers telling me about the  changes they've made," said Tonay, a lecturer in psychology at the University  of California, Santa Cruz, who has received stories, poems, and letters of  thanks from readers and has spoken with many readers during radio  broadcasts.

That kind of feedback, and a request from her publisher, inspired Tonay  to produce a companion volume called The Creative Dreamer's Journal and  Workbook, which has just been published by Celestial Arts.

The dream journal, a 150-page hardbound book embellished with a  painting by Albert Joseph Moore on the cover, provides lots of space for  recording dreams, new worksheets and exercises to help dreamers interpret  their dreams, and dozens of inspiring quotes that Tonay has collected in her  own dream journals over the years to stimulate reflection. She also offers  tips for getting a good night's sleep and tips for helping dreamers remember  their dreams.

"I wanted to provide a beautiful frame for people to hold their most  private images," said Tonay, a licensed clinical psychologist who also has a  private counseling practice in Santa Cruz. "I wanted to give people a place to  explore the themes that occur in their dreams over time and to offer  guidance that would help them understand more about themselves, their  feelings, and their interactions in the world."

Tonay, who has interpreted more than 15,000 dreams during her  career, believes that dreams are an important outlet for many emotions that  often go unexpressed during our waking hours. Her first book reveals what  people most commonly dream about, the meaning of emotions in dreams, and  some themes of creative people's dreams. It offers practical guidance for  those interested in exploring dreams as a channel of self-understanding and  suggests ways "to overcome blocks in your life by listening to your dreams,"  as Tonay wrote in the introduction to The Creative Dreamer's Journal and  Workbook.

"Of the two books, the journal feels more personal to me," said Tonay.  "I like to imagine a person opening it up, reading a quote, and then reflecting  on it. I want to encourage readers to make their journals a personal  treasure, because dreams are so creative. They're like stories."

Selected quotes excerpted from The Creative Dreamer's Journal and  Workbook:
* I was not looking for my dreams to interpret life, but rather for my life to  interpret my dreams. -Susan Sontag
* I am never afraid of what I know. -Anna Sewell
* I do believe it is possible to create, even without writing a word or painting  a picture, by simply molding one's inner life. And that too is a deed. -Etty Hillesum
* Everyone has talent. What is rare is the courage to follow the talent to the  dark place where it leads. -Erica Jong
* In our dreams (writes Coleridge) images represent the sensations we think  they cause; we do not feel horror because we are threatened by a sphinx; we  dream of a sphinx to explain the horror we feel. -Jorge Luis Borges
