SANTA CRUZ, CA--Mad cows, laughing cannibals, itchy sheep, and ten  new cases of a rare human brain disorder called Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease (CJD) in Great Britain are all part of a puzzle that has  scientists stymied. In these diseases, as well as other neurological  disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, dense  plaques of misfolded proteins mysteriously clog up the brain.

How proteins fold and unfold--and what happens when the  folding goes haywire--are questions of interest to biochemists  Anthony Fink, Lydia Gregoret, and Glenn Millhauser at the University  of California, Santa Cruz. Their research focuses on different  aspects of protein folding, such as what controls the final shapes of  proteins, how they clump into damaging plaques, and how to prevent  those plaques from forming.

Some of their work focuses on a band of renegade proteins  called prions (PREE-ons), the alleged cause of mad cow and related  diseases. Unlike either bacteria or viruses, prions contain no genetic  material; they are the only protein thought to transmit disease. All  prion diseases cause neurological problems and inevitably lead to  death. The diseases include sheep scrapie and three human disorders:  CJD, Fatal Familial Insomnia, and Kuru--called the "laughing death"  by New Guinea cannibals, who appeared to get the disease from  ritually eating human brains.

"The chances of someone getting these diseases are clearly  pretty low," says Fink. Even so, the UCSC studies could help  scientists understand the basic workings of these and other more  common neurodegenerative diseases.

Prions are harmless in their normal state. Shaped like folded  slinkies, they dot the outside of neurons, serving an unknown, but  probably useful, function. On rare occasions they may unwind and  refold into rippled sheets. These misfolded prions initiate a domino- like cascade of prion refolding until the entire brain teems with  dangerously crinkled prions.

The first misfolded prions may arise from a mutation, but they  can also be ingested. Prions are unusual in being able to survive the  burbling acidic soup of the stomach. Not only this, but they also  appear to trek up to the brain, overcome the blood-brain barrier,  then march into the unsuspecting gray matter. Prion-diseased brains  then become riddled with a network of spongy holes and contain  dense plaques where misfolded prions have clumped together.

Despite some skepticism about whether prions can accomplish  these feats of protein migration, most scientists believe that  feeding parts of infected sheep to cattle is what kicked off the mad- cow epidemic in Great Britain. Some scientists also believe the ten  new CJD cases may have resulted from people eating infected beef.  However, Fink says, "The evidence that people picked up this disease  from eating beef is highly speculative."

Prion clumps in diseased brains form into long fibers, as if  each misformed prion reaches out to hold hands with the one next  door. Glenn Millhauser, an associate professor of chemistry and  biochemistry, studies how these prion chains arise. With  researchers at UC San Francisco, Millhauser's group--including  graduate student Karen Lundberg and postdoctoral researcher Chris  Stenland--devised a way to monitor prion fragments as they  metamorphose from their proper springlike coils into long strands of  misfolded prions.

This work has begun to answer questions about the genesis of  prion chains. In the past, scientists were unsure whether prions  crystallize into their alternate form, or if individual misfolded  prions actively convert their neighbors. Results from Millhauser's  lab support the first model. Misfolded prions seem to act as seed  crystals, initiating a wave of crystallization into the damaging  rippled shape.

The shape so dangerous in prions is actually a common protein  form, taken on as part of the normal healthy function of some  proteins. Assistant professor of biology Lydia Gregoret worked with  computer scientist David Haussler, graduate student Melissa Cline,  and undergraduate Albion Baucom to create a computer program that  predicts which proteins will fold into this shape, called a beta- pleated sheet.

"Normal proteins fold and unfold all the time with no harmful  consequences," says Gregoret, but most of them eventually assume  one preferred shape. Prions are unusual in their ability to switch  from a coil to a pleated sheet, and especially unusual in their  obstinate refusal to switch back.

Fink, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry, studies  another coiled protein that occasionally gets stuck in the pleated  sheet form. This protein seems to form aggregates when partially  folded proteins interact and induce each other to form stable pleated  sheets. Fink is trying to find ways of stopping prions and other  pleated-sheet aggregates from forming by preventing the proteins  from ever grabbing hold of each other. He is looking for small  molecules that will give proteins something to latch onto besides  each other, thwarting any attempts to form chains.
