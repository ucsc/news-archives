SANTA CRUZ, CA--Like a parent asked to choose a favorite child, G.  William Domhoff won't say if he prefers his work on dreams or his  research on the power of the corporate rich. Domhoff, a professor of  psychology and sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz,  has devoted his career to the study of both subjects. On April 27, the  public is invited to hear Domhoff discuss his life's work at 8 p.m. in  the Performing Arts Theater on the UCSC campus.

Domhoff is presenting the 28th Annual Faculty Research  Lecture, an honor bestowed by the Santa Cruz Division of the  Academic Senate to recognize outstanding work by a faculty  member.

Domhoff, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1965 as a founding  member and is now serving as acting dean of the Division of Social  Sciences, uses an objective, quantitative method to study dreams.  "Unlike Jungians or Freudians, we only look at other dreams to  understand a dream," says Domhoff. The method gives an accurate  picture of an individual by revealing his or her concerns, beliefs,  self-esteem, and relationships with family and other significant  people, says Domhoff.

"If we have 100 dreams from the same person--whom we've  never met--we can make accurate predictions about a number of  things," says Domhoff, who "scores" dream content by tabulating  factors such as the number of male and female characters, the  frequency of recurring themes, and elements such as aggression and  victimization. Those scores are compared to set standards, or  norms, that have been developed and replicated four times by  researchers since 1950. "We've found that there is definite  continuity between dreams and waking thoughts, and between  dreams and waking behavior," says Domhoff.

This method, called the Hall/Van de Castle coding method, was  developed in part by Domhoff's mentor Calvin S. Hall. Domhoff, whose  work includes cross-cultural dream analysis, says the method is a  powerful tool that can be used to analyze an individual's dreams, to  compare the dreams of men and women, and to learn about groups by  collecting the most recent dream of 100 people in a certain group  and comparing those dreams to the norm.

Domhoff is the author of twelve books, including "The Mystique  of Dreams: A Search for Utopia Through Senoi Dream Theory"  (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985), and a just- completed comprehensive manuscript on dream research titled "Do  Dreams Have Meaning? A Quantitative Approach to an Age-Old  Question."

Domhoff's dream research marks a return to a subject he  pursued early in his career. During the turbulent civil rights era,  Domhoff set aside his dream work to study the power of America's  elite. His book "Who Rules America?" (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.:  Prentice-Hall, 1967) became a classic in the field of sociology.  Domhoff mapped the structure of the upper classes in the United  States, showing the institutional links among members of the  "power elite" and how they influenced government policy-making  through their support of foundations, think tanks, blue-ribbon  commissions, and institutes at prestigious universities.

"The links aren't obvious, but they're not secret, either," says  Domhoff. "Americans as a group are reluctant to acknowledge the  existence of the power elite, but the rich are in fact a very cohesive  group that attends the same schools, goes to the same clubs,  vacations at the same summer resorts, and shares a view of the  world."

Domhoff says his book, and the sequel "Who Rules America  Now? A View for the '80s" (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall,  1983), are his responses to people who don't believe that a wealthy  few control the United States. Yet he says he did not find the  projects disillusioning. "I think if you understand what's going on,  you've got a chance of dealing with it," he says. "The reason the  elites are in power is that they're slightly better organized than the  rest of us, and they have the resources to put in critical places. The  paradox is that Americans have enormous individual freedom and  rights--we can believe what we want, wear what we want, and act  the way we want to act--but that doesn't automatically translate  into political power. Ordinary Americans are less organized in terms  of social power than people in any other advanced industrial  society."

Domhoff, who has announced that he will retire this year, will  discuss both areas of research during the lecture that he has dubbed  his "swan song."

"My work on power has had a greater impact and is much better  known, but in the long run, I'll bet my dream research stands just as  tall," says Domhoff.
