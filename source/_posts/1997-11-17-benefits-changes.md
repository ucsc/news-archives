UCSC employees have until Friday, November 21, to make changes to their benefits packages during this year's Open Enrollment. Any changes employees would like to make to their health, vision, dental, DepCare, and TIP plans can only be made once a year, during the Open Enrollment period that started November 1 this year.

Changes take effect January 1, 1998.
