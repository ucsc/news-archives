**Campus To Name New School Of Engineering In His Honor**

SAN JOSE, CA--Prominent Santa Cruz community philanthropist Jack  Baskin, a retired developer and engineer, announced today that he  will support the new School of Engineering at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, with a gift of $5 million--by far the largest  private donation in the 32-year history of the campus.

In recognition of Baskin's gift, UCSC will name its first  professional school the Jack Baskin School of Engineering. The  school represents a major expansion of UCSC's existing programs in  computer engineering and computer science into several new fields,  including electrical engineering and applied and engineering  mathematics (see separate news release).

Baskin's donation will help UCSC attract topflight faculty  members, offer scholarships, purchase equipment, and establish a  permanent endowment to provide future income for the School of  Engineering. UCSC will receive at least $3 million within the next  two years, which the campus may use in an entrepreneurial way to  support engineering activities of its choosing. Baskin has  irrevocably committed through a trust the remaining $2 million, a  sum reserved for the school's endowment.

"Jack Baskin's generous gift establishes a new benchmark for  philanthropic contributions to UC Santa Cruz and in the Central  Coast area," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "It speaks to a  wonderful partnership between an institution and an individual who  has dreamed of making new futures possible for the young people of  this region, the state, and beyond."

Daniel G. Aldrich III, assistant chancellor for University  Advancement, notes that Baskin's gift serves as a capstone to his  long history of supporting UCSC--from an initial 1971 donation of a  boat that he sailed across the Pacific Ocean to Tahiti. His lifetime  gifts and pledges to the campus now total more than $6.5 million.

"Jack Baskin is a self-made man, and he has always felt that  education unlocks the door to the American dream," Aldrich said. "He  was trained as an engineer, and engineering has served him well. To  re-create that opportunity for others of lesser means, at the best  public higher education system in the world, was a chance he could  not pass up."

Baskin, founder of the construction and housing company Jack  Baskin, Inc., says his latest gift reflects his conviction that  engineering is a critical discipline for the future well-being of the  region and the state. He adds that for UCSC to train leading  engineers, a School of Engineering will prove far more effective than  two or three isolated programs.

"A well-rounded major research university needs a School of  Engineering," he said. "This will greatly enhance UCSC's role and  reputation in the state. The new programs that the campus has  planned are a great start, and I'm looking forward to seeing how the  school evolves."

Because he has been a friend to the campus for most of its  history, Baskin has seen UCSC's plans for a School of Engineering ebb  and flow with the state's changing budgetary fortunes and other  factors. Now, his gift is the cornerstone to making the school a  reality.

"I've been pushing for this school for some time, as have many  others," Baskin said. "Sometimes in philanthropy it takes a major  initial gift to get a program going. I'm pleased to be able to play that  role."

On a more personal level, Baskin noted, "Engineering was a  stepping-stone for me. By funding the School of Engineering, I am  paying back to the university, the community, and the country the  great opportunities that were given to me. As young engineers  graduate from UCSC, I will be delighted to know that they are on the  road to success, just as I was."

Chancellor Greenwood and Assistant Chancellor Aldrich believe  that Baskin's gift will trigger numerous other donations from  industry and the private sector to support the School of Engineering.  Indeed, several such gifts are pending and will be announced in the  near future.
