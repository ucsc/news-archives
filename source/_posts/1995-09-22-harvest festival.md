SANTA CRUZ, CA--Good food, live music, great raffle prizes, and  games for children are just a few of the reasons to visit the second  annual Harvest Festival at the University of California, Santa Cruz,  on Saturday, October 14. The event will be held at the 25-acre Farm  on the UCSC campus.

The festival was such a success last year that organizers  decided to have more fun by extending the hours this year to 11 a.m.  to 5 p.m. Other activities include gardening workshops, a winter  squash tasting, tours of the Farm, and a plant and produce sale.  Admission to the festival is $2; admission is free for children under  twelve and members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm and Garden,  which is sponsoring the event.

Bluegrass music will be provided by Harmony Grits from 12 to  2 p.m., followed by Mariposa, an acoustic folk duet, that will take  the stage from 2 to 4 p.m.

Three workshops will appeal to gardeners: Orin Martin will  help you prepare for winter with his talk at noon called "Putting the  Garden to Bed," which will feature cover crop techniques and other  steps to take before the mercury drops; entomologist Sean Swezey  will discuss biological pest control strategies for backyard  gardeners at 1:30 p.m.; and Christof Bernau will introduce perennials  and native plants that make a nice show in garden borders. His talk  begins at 3 p.m.

Local merchants have pitched in again this year by contributing  to a raffle that will help fund scholarships in UCSC's Apprenticeship  in Ecological Horticulture. The apprenticeship is a six-month  training course in organic farming and gardening that is sponsored  by UCSC's Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.  Raffle prizes include $100 gift certificates from Integrand Design  and Smith and Hawken; $50 gift certificates from Gabriella Cafe and  Cafe Bittersweet; and $25 gift certificates from Food Bin and San  Lorenzo Lumber Company.

Raffle tickets cost $2 each or six for $10; they will be  available at the festival, as well as at the produce cart at the High  Street entrance of campus on Tuesdays and Fridays from noon to 6  p.m.

Fresh-squeezed apple juice will be available for sipping, and  organically grown produce will be available for purchase, including  dry-farmed tomatoes, sweet corn, winter squash, salad greens, and  pumpkins. Farm tours will be available, and proceeds from a bake  sale will also go toward the apprenticeship scholarships.
