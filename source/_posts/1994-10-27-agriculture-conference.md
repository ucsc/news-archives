SANTA CRUZ, CA--A daylong conference titled "Community and  Agriculture--Understanding the Concerns of a Changing Region," on  Saturday, November 12, will address the pressures facing  agriculture in Monterey, San Benito, and Santa Cruz counties.

Central Coast agriculture generates food and jobs and  preserves open space, but the growing urban population is  threatening the viability of agriculture in the region. The conference  is designed to bring together key players in the community to learn  about resource and land-use conflicts and to discuss the  preservation of agriculture.

The conference, which is open to the public, will be held in the  Henry Mello Theater of Watsonville High School, 250 East Beach  Street, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Liz Scott Graham, California field  representative for the Central Valley Project of American Farmland  Trust, will deliver the keynote address at 9:10 a.m. (See attached  agenda for detailed schedule information.) Admission is $10,  including a catered lunch, or $5 for those who bring their own lunch.

The conference is sponsored by the Agriculture and Community  Project (AgComm) of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable  Food Systems at the University of California, Santa Cruz. AgComm is  an applied research project that examines the status of agriculture  in the Monterey Bay region and the effects of policy, development,  and environmental pressures on the industry.

AgComm is also a member of the California Alliance for  Sustainable Agriculture (CASA), a collaboration of seven nonprofit  organizations and three UC programs. With assistance from the W.  K. Kellogg Foundation, CASA's mission is to encourage sustainable  food and agricultural systems in California.
