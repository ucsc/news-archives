With a little preparation, Central Coast gardeners can harvest food from their gardens all year round. Learn how to prepare your garden for fall and winter at a four-hour workshop at UCSC on Sunday, September 27, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. The class will take place at the UCSC Farm.

Instructor Albie Miles will cover topics including:
* variety selection and planting times for fall and winter vegetable and fruit crops
* seasonal care of the soil, including mulches and cover crops
* a demonstration of direct sowing and transplanting techniques
* an overview of French intensive soil and bed preparations, and tips for enhancing soil fertility

Cost of the class is $35 for the general public; $30 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden. Space is limited, so preregister by Tuesday, September 22. Proceeds benefit the public education and outreach work of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.

The Farm is located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available across the street from the Blacksmith Shop in the Physical Plant parking lot.

For more information or to register, call John Fisher.
