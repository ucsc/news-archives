title: Epidemic Homicide Rate In United States Caused By Culture And  Guns, According To Uc Santa Cruz Professor

SANTA CRUZ, CA--About 25,000 people die by murder or  manslaughter each year in the United States. This translates into a  homicide rate of 1 murder or manslaughter for every 10,000 people,  a rate roughly 50 times higher than that of New Zealand, 15 times  higher than that of Great Britain, and 12 times higher than that of  France.

In a recently published study, professor of sociology Dane  Archer of the University of California, Santa Cruz, concluded that  America's high homicide rate comes from two sources: our culture's  predisposition toward violence and the unique access Americans  have to guns. The results of the study were published in the New  York State Bar Association's journal Law Studies ("American  Violence: How High and Why?", fall 1994).

Archer's views of America's predisposition toward violence  stem in part from the results of a creative problem-solving test he  gave to more than 2,500 secondary-school students in the United  States and ten other nations: Australia, Canada, England, France,  Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, and Sweden.  UCSC alumna Patty McDaniel, who earned a B.A. in sociology in 1989,  was one of several undergraduates who assisted in the initial stages  of the research.

The students chosen for the test, ages 16-18, were from  similar social and class backgrounds. They were asked to write  fictional stories based on characters' reactions to a set of 12  different scenarios, including a confrontation with an unfaithful  spouse, punishing a child, a protest at a factory, and a conflict at  work.

Responses from the American youths were clearly more violent  and graphic than those from most of their non-American peers,  Archer said. "In the United States, the stories tend to include gothic  tales of destruction, where everyone dies in a hail of bullets. In  England and other countries, the response may be one slap. In the  Swedish stories, there's almost no violence."

A close reading of the 8,000 stories Archer collected led him  to surmise that Americans have a cultural predisposition to  anticipate violence.

"Americans see lethal violence as a not-unlikely outcome when  conflicts occur," said Archer. "It may mean that they fear violence,  expect violence, or even justify violence as a means of solving  conflicts more than do people in other societies."

Archer concedes that further research is needed to determine  exactly why Americans appear to be inclined to solve problems with  violence. In the same study, however, he looked at some popular  explanations for America's violent culture in light of experiences  had by other nations. These explanations included our nation's  history of frontier justice, wars, ethnic diversity, urban crowding,  and the prevalence and easy availability of firearms.

Almost none of the explanations for violence survived the  cross-cultural scrutiny. For example, Archer found that Australia,  New Zealand, and Canada--each frontier societies with violent  histories--had some of the lowest rates of homicide in the  industrialized world. He found that New Zealand, England, and other  countries boasted a diverse cultural and ethnic population, but didn't  suffer from epidemic homicide rates. He found that the enormous,  crowded cities of Paris, Tokyo, and London have only a fraction of  the homicide rates found in New Orleans, St. Louis, Detroit, and  Washington, D.C.

Where the United States differs from other industrial nations  is in its lack of stringent restrictions on guns, Archer found. "Most  societies, including the United States, have restrictions on  firearms," he said. "However, other industrialized nations draw the  line much more narrowly."

For example, European nations allow "birding weapons," he  explains, including shotguns, birdshot-type weapons, and weapons  used in deer hunting. "They don't allow the relatively unrestricted  access to powerful weapons, like semiautomatic rifles, that  America does, and they don't allow concealable weapons," he said.

Recent polls have shown that as many as half of American  households own guns, said Archer, citing statistics provided by the  federal Department of Justice. And, he noted, guns are involved in  nearly 65 percent of all murders or manslaughters in the U.S.

After viewing America's experience compared to that of other  nations, Archer concluded that the proliferation of firearms, in  combination with the predisposition Americans have toward  violence, best explains the high homicide rate in the United States.

"It takes access to firearms and the expectation that lethal  violence will be the way problems are solved to generate America's  high homicide rate," Archer said.
