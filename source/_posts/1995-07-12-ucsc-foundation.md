SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California, Santa Cruz,  Foundation has elected Stoddard P. Johnston of Pebble Beach to serve  as president of the board, announced Daniel G. Aldrich III, assistant  chancellor for University Advancement at UCSC. In addition, the  Foundation has added five new trustees.

Johnston is chairman and CEO of KBOQ, a classical music  station based in Monterey. He entered the radio and television  business after graduating from Yale in 1950, where he had chaired  the college radio station. During his lengthy career, he served as  president and general manager of KMBY in Seaside and KWAV in  Monterey, and as chairman of KMST-TV (now KCCN) in Monterey.

Johnston joined the Foundation board in 1989. His involvement  with UCSC dates back to 1966, when he joined the university's Media  Council. In that role, he has provided counsel and guidance to  members of the student media at UCSC.

As president, Johnston will guide the board in its private fund- raising efforts, which promote and support academic programs,  scholarships and fellowships, and capital improvements at UCSC. His  one-year term began July 1, and may be renewed for a second year.

Also newly named as officers were George A. Malloch of San  Francisco as vice president and Fred S. Farr of Carmel as  parliamentarian. John M. Halliday of Mill Valley, who served as  president for 1993-95, was named past president.

Five new trustees were welcomed to the board in June.  Selected as part of a plan to increase UCSC Foundation membership  from 31 to 50 over a period of several years, their appointments  boost membership on the board to 39.

The new trustees, who come from a variety of backgrounds, are  as follows:
* Margaret S. Lyons Giberson of Los Gatos has taught French,  Spanish, German, and English at the high school level and French at  the community college level. She is currently a candidate for a J.D.  from Golden Gate University School of Law. Giberson and her  husband, Alan Giberson, pledged a $250,000 gift to UCSC in June to  establish an endowed chair in environmental studies. The Gibersons  were inspired to make the donation by the influence a UCSC  professor's mentorship had on their son and their own conviction  about the importance of environmental studies as a discipline, said  Margaret Giberson. Their son, Erik Giberson, earned a bachelor's  degree from UCSC last year.
* Ernest "Bud" T. Kretschmer of Aptos is retired after a wide- ranging career which included owning and operating nursing homes  and serving in the U.S. Air Force. Kretschmer studied music at an  early age and never lost his love for it, even as practical  considerations led him into other careers. After moving to the Santa  Cruz area in 1962, he became involved in launching the first Cabrillo  Music Festival and joined its board and the board of the Santa Cruz  Symphony. He earned an associate's degree from Aquinas College in  East Lansing, Michigan, in 1935; a bachelor's degree from Michigan  State University in 1938; and a master's degree from the Graduate  School of Business at Columbia University in 1951.
* Julian L. Peabody of San Francisco is a retired attorney who  specialized in trust and estate law. He holds a J.D. from Columbia  Law School and a bachelor's degree from Princeton University. His  granddaughter, Jennifer Davies, was a junior this past year at UCSC.
* Dwight Steffensen of Seal Beach is president and chief  operating officer of Bergen Brunswig Corporation, a national  distributor of pharmaceuticals and medical and surgical products  based in Orange, California. He received a bachelor's degree in  economics from Stanford University in 1965 and is a Certified  Public Accountant. His son, Jon Eric Steffensen, is an alumnus of  UCSC.
* Michael Woo of Los Angeles is the western states director  for the Corporation for National Service. Appointed by President  Clinton, he oversees programs including AmeriCorps VISTA and the  National Senior Service Corps. He served on the Los Angeles City  Council from 1985 to 1993, leaving the council to run for mayor of  Los Angeles. Woo holds a bachelor's degree in politics and urban  studies from UCSC and a master's degree from UC Berkeley.

Since its inception in 1974, the Foundation has brought $33  million in private gift support to the university. Approximately $22  million has been distributed in the form of fellowships,  scholarships, capital improvements, and campus programs, and more  than $11 million has been invested in endowments and trusts. The  Foundation is a nonprofit public benefit corporation.
