The United States Congress awarded her the Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition in 1995.

For many years, she has been an advocate around disability and health issues. She was cofounder and first executive director of the Santa Cruz women's cancer organization, WomenCARE, and she was an early member of the Santa Cruz Women's Health Collective. She has served on the boards of several local nonprofit organizations, and she is an expert kayak and whitewater-raft guide who volunteers with groups offering wilderness outings to people with disabilities.
