## UC Santa Cruz Named 25th Best Campus Among National Public Universities

### Ranking Appears In U.S. News & World Report's 1998 "Best Colleges" Issue

SANTA CRUZ--In its 1998 assessment of colleges and universities,  U.S. News & World Report names the University of California, Santa  Cruz, the 25th best public campus in the country. The ranking  appears in the magazine's 11th annual "America's Best Colleges"  issue, on the newsstands beginning today (Monday, August 25).

"This high ranking marks another milestone in the rise of UC Santa Cruz as one of this country's leading universities," says  M.R.C. Greenwood, UCSC chancellor. "This national recognition of the  achievement of UCSC's faculty, students, and alumni reflects the  increasing public appreciation for the academic distinction that  characterizes the UC Santa Cruz campus."

In developing its 1998 rankings, U.S. News distributed detailed  questionnaires to 1,400 four-year schools earlier this year; 95 percent of the surveys were returned. Criteria by which the  schools are judged include academic reputation (provided by  presidents, provosts, and admissions deans at each school),  retention rate, faculty resources, student selectivity, financial  resources, value added (a measurement of the school's role in the  academic success of it students), and alumni-giving rate.

To provide meaningful comparisons, the magazine placed  colleges and universities into one of four categories: national  universities (the category in which UCSC was placed), national  liberal arts colleges, regional universities, and regional liberal arts  colleges.

UC Santa Cruz has also scored well in a number of recent  national surveys measuring commitment to instruction and quality  of research activities:

\-- In a comprehensive analysis of more than 200 top  universities, UCSC was ranked 15th in the nation among public  campuses in the overall quality of its research productivity. The  study was detailed in a book published earlier this year, The Rise of  American Research Universities: Elites and Challengers in the  Postwar Era.

\-- In the 1996 survey conducted by U.S. News, UCSC was ranked  13th among U.S. universities for its commitment to undergraduate  teaching.

\-- A National Research Council survey the same year ranked  two of UCSC's doctoral programs--astronomy and astrophysics and  linguistics--in the top 10 programs nationwide. Two  other programs--earth sciences and biochemistry/molecular  biology--placed in the survey's top quartile.

\-- In several assessments measuring the average number of  times a published paper is cited by researchers, the Philadelphia- based Institute for Scientific Information has judged research  findings by UCSC faculty to be among the most highly regarded in the  country.
