SANTA CRUZ, CA--James Zachos, an assistant professor of earth  sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is one of 197  outstanding scientists to receive a Young Investigator Award from  the National Science Foundation, the foundation announced last week.

The award helps universities attract and retain outstanding  faculty researchers who might not otherwise pursue teaching  careers. Each winner receives a base award of $25,000 per year for  five years from NSF, plus up to $75,000 per year through a  combination of federal grants and funds from industry, for a  maximum annual award of $100,000.

Zachos specializes in paleoclimatology, the study of earth's  ancient climate. Scientists in this field try to reconstruct global  patterns of temperature, ice cover, atmospheric gases, and other  aspects of climate from millions of years ago by looking for clues in  rocks and fossils. In particular, Zachos studies the shells of tiny  marine organisms, which settle to the ocean floor and eventually  form thick layers of sediment. Scientists drill into the seafloor,  retrieve the sediments, and study the chemical compositions of the  ancient shells. This reveals the temperature of the water in which  they lived. In this way, Zachos has created maps of the ocean's  temperature at various times in the past, dating to tens of millions  of years ago. His work has helped show that earth's climate can  change abruptly, for reasons that researchers do not yet grasp.

Zachos, 35, received a B.S. in geology and economics from the  State University of New York, College at Oneonta, an M.S. in geology  from the University of South Carolina, and a Ph.D. in geological  oceanography from the Graduate School of Oceanography at the  University of Rhode Island. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1992. In  1993, he was one of six scientists chosen for the prestigious Joint  Oceanographic Institutions/U.S. Science Advisory Committee  Distinguished Lecturer Series.

Since 1987, twelve scientists at UCSC have received the NSF  awards, previously known as Presidential Young Investigator  Awards. The program began in 1983.
