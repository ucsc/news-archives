Assemblymember Fred Keeley (D-27th District) and state senator Bruce McPherson (R-15th District) delivered good news for the campus community at UCSC's 1998 legislative forum, held Friday at College Eight.

"I think it will be a good year for higher education and education in general," McPherson told the audience of 30. "As far as students go, we're on the right track, with student fees decreasing for the first time in some time."

Both legislators noted that education has become a top priority within state government and with the public in general. Keeley and McPherson are both involved in discussions for a proposed bond issue that may provide funding for capitol projects for K-12 and higher education.

Keeley noted that "we need to decide how to deal with the next wave of students who will be coming through" and keep the issue of affordability of education in mind. "I don't think we've done much to address that challenge," he said.

McPherson and Keeley spent much of the forum fielding questions from members of the audience. The issues of graduate fee reduction, child care, welfare reform, and UC's stance on bargaining with teaching assistants were among those presented during the question-and-answer session.
