You had to be quick at the Second Annual Social Sciences 1 Bake-Off on December 9. The treats were there one minute and gone the next as hordes of hungry students, faculty, and staff members descended to taste--and judge--the entries in four categories: hors d'oeuvres, main dishes, breads, and desserts.

Sponsored by the Anthropology Department, the bake-off took place in the third-floor lobby of the Social Sciences 1 Building. The winners, each of whom won a pair of movie passes, were determined by ballots submitted by tasters. They are:
* **Hors d'oeuvre**\--Kristen Cheney, anthropology graduate student, for Samosas
* **Main dish**\--Nancy Lenox, Social Sciences Division financial manager, for spinach quiche
* **Bread**\--Debbie Neal, anthropology administrative manager, for jalapeno cheese bread
* **Dessert**\--Marilyn Chapin, economics adviser, for cheesecake

Congratulations to all!
