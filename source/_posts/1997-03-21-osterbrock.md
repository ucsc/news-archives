SANTA CRUZ, CA--In 1892, wealthy railway magnate Charles T.  Yerkes of Chicago set out to "lick the Lick"--the University of  California's Lick Observatory--by financing "the largest and best  telescope in the world." Five years later, his ambitions took concrete  form in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, when astronomers dedicated Yerkes  Observatory, home to a mammoth 40-inch refracting telescope.

Now, in the observatory's centennial year, the University of  Chicago Press has published the compelling story of the first half-century at Yerkes Observatory and the three men who directed it  with varying degrees of success and personal turmoil. Titled Yerkes  Observatory, 1892-1950: The Birth, Near Death, and Resurrection of a  Scientific Research Institution, the book richly illustrates the  challenges of running a "big-science" establishment, as well as the  reasons behind the ascendance of American astronomy in the 20th  century.

The book's author, Donald Osterbrock, is uniquely qualified to  tell this tale. A member of the National Academy of Sciences and a  distinguished astronomer in his own right, Osterbrock studied at  Yerkes in the 1940s and 1950s and holds several degrees from its  parent institution, the University of Chicago. He has become a leading  chronicler of American astronomy with this, his fourth historical  book. Further, he has firsthand knowledge of many of the same  situations his three protagonists faced: Osterbrock directed Lick  Observatory from 1973 to 1981. He now is professor emeritus of  astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa  Cruz.

"Writing about the history of astronomy is, in a sense, a search  for my own roots," Osterbrock said. "I see myself more and more as  one member of a line of people who go back to the astronomy of 100  years ago."

In the book's preface, Osterbrock expands upon this theme and  acknowledges that his judgments of the three Yerkes directors are  necessarily colored by his own lens: "I can see myself all too clearly  in some of their less noble actions, taken, they believed, from the  highest of motives, for their observatory, their university, and their  science."

The first director at Yerkes, and the man most responsible for  its rapid rise, was George Ellery Hale. Hale was just 24 when he and  University of Chicago president William Rainey Harper called upon  Charles Yerkes and made their case for an observatory to top the  legacy of eccentric California businessman James Lick. In the  ensuing years Hale saw to it that the observatory would lead the  world in the new science of astrophysics--studying the nature of  celestial objects using the laws of physics--rather than simpler  astronomical observations of motions.

"Hale had tremendous amounts of nervous energy," Osterbrock  recounted. "He was young and ambitious, and from the beginning he  wanted to organize his scientists, to make astronomy like the  company his father ran so well."

But that same energy to excel at all costs lured Hale to  California's Mount Wilson in 1903, where a 60-inch reflecting  telescope soon eclipsed that at Yerkes as the world's largest. Yerkes  was left in the considerably less busy hands of Edwin B. Frost, whose  lack of vision (both figuratively and literally, as he went blind in  1921) and initiative nearly doomed Yerkes. During Frost's 27 years as  director, Osterbrock writes bluntly, "He brought no new scientific  ideas to the observatory."

Perhaps Frost's most important action was to help rescue a  brilliant young Russian scientist, Otto Struve, in 1921 from an army  relief camp in Turkey. An obsessive and hard-driving man, Struve was  an excellent researcher who was to become the savior of Yerkes,  directing it for 18 years (1932-1950). He also recruited several  astrophysicists who would gain international renown. Most notable  were three foreign scientists: Subramanyan Chandrasekhar of India,  Gerard Kuiper of Holland, and Bengt Str√∂mgren of Denmark. Yerkes and  the University of Chicago's Astronomy Department were once again at  the pinnacle of the field, especially in the years after World War II.

Struve's relentless focus on his work and the endless  administrative details of running an observatory extracted a heavy  toll as his career progressed. His recruits matured and nurtured their  own reputations and egos, and conflicts inevitably erupted. While  most of Struve's actions served the observatory--and American  astronomy--well in the long term, some seem harsh in retrospect.  For instance, he eased out one staff member who spent time with his  wife after the birth of their child rather than working continuously  at an affiliated observing station in Texas.

Frost, on the other hand, trod water scientifically but was a  warm, sympathetic man, well liked by his staff and the residents of  Williams Bay. Visitors to the town today may see Frost Park, Frost  Drive, Frost Woods, and a Frost House, but nothing named after Struve  or Hale, who also suffered from mental illness later in life.  "Astrophysics is hard work, but you also have to have compassion for  human beings," Osterbrock said.

In a poignant section of the epilogue, Osterbrock notes that  Frost reflected happily on his life and died surrounded by family and  friends, while Struve died bitter and alone. The author wonders:  "Which was better?"
