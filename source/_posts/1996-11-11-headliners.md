Elections make news, and UCSC folks helped provide context and commentary for reporters. KSBW-TV tapped **Anthony Pratkanis** of psychology and **Bob Meister** of politics for help with their live analysis of election returns. The _Santa Cruz County Sentinel _also turned to Pratkanis for insight into the campaign-financing woes of local city council candidate Eleanor Eisenberg and the impact of negative campaigning. The _Sentinel _also covered an election forum held by **Michael Brown**, **Dan Wirls**, **Ronnie Lipschutz**, and **Mark Harmon** of politics.  

The expansion of UCSC's engineering programs, starting next fall with faculty hires in electrical engineering and applied mathematics, received widespread notice in the region. Chancellor **M.R.C. Greenwood,** Executive Vice Chancellor **Michael Tanner,** and associate dean for engineering **Pat Mantey** shared interview duties with the _San Jose Mercury News, Santa Cruz County Sentinel, _KSCO radio, KCCN-TV and KSBW-TV, and student reporters at UCSC and San Jose State University. The Associated Press, Salinas_ Californian,_ and Watsonville_ Register-Pajaronian_ all carried reports.  

Historian **Judy Yung** continues to get attention for her award-winning book, _Unbound Feet._ The book was recently reviewed in the_ Journal of American History,_ which called it "a significant contribution to minority ethnic studies."

The _San Jose and Silicon Valley Business Journal_ devoted some ink to **Lora Martin's** appointment as the first full-time director of the UC MBEST Center at Fort Ord, UCSC's innovative research and technology initiative. The _Journal_ also gave prominent play to physicist **Sue Carter's** $500,000 fellowship from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.
