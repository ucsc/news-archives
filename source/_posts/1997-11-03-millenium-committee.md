The UCSC Millennium Committee has established a new Web site to keep the campus community up to date on its activities.

A link to the Web page has also been  added to the UCSC home page: <http://www.ucsc.edu>.

The Millennium Committee was established by Chancellor Greenwood in July 1997 to reassess and articulate the basic values and goals that will guide UCSC into the next century. The committee, made up of faculty, staff, students, and a representative of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, is meeting regularly through the fall and winter quarters and gathering information from the campus community and key external constituencies. The committee will prepare a report on its findings in spring 1998.

The new Millennium Committee Web site includes a list of committee members as well as the complete text of the committee's charge. Summaries of committee and subcommittee meetings are also available online. The Millennium Committee is inviting input from anyone interested in this important planning process. You can use the comment box provided in the Web site. Comments will be summarized regularly for distribution to committee members.
