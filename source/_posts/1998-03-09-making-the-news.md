**Chancellor Greenwood** was quoted in two different stories in mid-February on the function in obese people of Lepti--a hormone that signals people on when to stop eating. The first story appeared in the _Chicago Tribune_ and was picked up by the _Seattle Times._ In the story, Greenwood observes that genes that were invaluable to people in times of food scarcity work against us now in our culture of little activity and excessive high-calorie foods. The Associated Press ran a story on the same subject that also quoted Greenwood. That story was picked up by the _Orange County Register,_ the _Garden State Press,_ and the _San Mateo Times._

Sociologist **Craig Reinarman** wrote a lengthy article for the _San Jose Mercury News_ Perspective section on the war on drugs and its escalating cost to society. The article is based on Reinarman's book, _Crack in America: Demon Drugs and Social Justice_ (University of California Press), written with Harry Levine and published last fall.

The _Los Angeles Times_ tapped elephant seal expert **Burney Le Boeuf** for a story that addressed the viewing of marine mammals.

An exhibit of work by painter **Patrick Aherne** earned a rave review from _San Francisco Chronicle_ art critic Kenneth Baker. "If recognition kept pace with accomplishment, Patrick Aherne would be one of Northern California's most celebrated painters," he said. . . . And Chicago's _New Art Examiner_ quoted artist **E. G. Crichton** for a story on teaching new media.

Joining the local debate on Proposition 227, the controversial initiative to limit bilingual education in California, was psychology's **Barry McLaughlin,** who penned an opinion piece for the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel._ McLaughlin argues that instead of doing away with bilingual education we should be promoting two-way immersion programs and encouraging bilingualism in all students. McLaughlin's op ed appeared in the January 19 issue of Currents online.

UCSC's **New Teacher Project,** in which successful veteran teachers coach first- and second-year teachers, was glowingly portrayed in an article in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel._ With class-size reductions, new teachers are being hired in California in record numbers, many with only emergency teaching credentials, and state school officials are looking closely at the New Teacher Project as a model for getting these rookies the help they need. Project director **Ellen Moir** and outreach coordinator **Barbara Davis** are quoted in the story.

UCSC students **Audrey Johnson** and **Brynn Kusic** were pictured on the front page of the business section of the _San Jose Mercury News_ taking part in a protest in San Jose. Environmental and labor groups oppose a proposed free-trade accord, which, they say, would lead to sweatshops and environmental degradation.
