title: UC Santa Cruz Marine Biologists Find Biodiversity Flourishing In Rocky Zone Between Tides In Northern Monterey Bay

SANTA CRUZ, CA--At the base of a cliff below the Santa Cruz  lighthouse, early morning low tide finds 47 student researchers  from UC Santa Cruz poking under boulders, peering into tide pools,  and sifting through surf grass to find every species inhabiting the  rocky zone between the tides. It looks like fun, and is, but there's  more to it: The students' work is part of a unique long-term study to  determine how increased human use has affected the wildlife living  in this narrow zone along central California's popular coastline.

Their results might come as a surprise: When comparing  surveys conducted in the early 1970s to a 1996 survey, the  researchers found no decrease in the number of species despite  increasingly heavy human use of the Santa Cruz County and southern  San Mateo County sites examined. John Pearse, professor emeritus of  biology at UCSC, and his student colleagues now have the most  complete long-term species lists available for specific sites on  central California's rocky shores.

Overall, the researchers have cataloged 723 species at 10  sites, although not all species occur at all sites. Students found  more total species at each location in 1996 than in the early '70s.  Explaining the higher numbers for 1996, Pearse says, "There's a lot  of rare species you see only every third or fifth visit, because  they're inconspicuous--or you're not trained to see them."

At each site, only about half the species found in the '70s also  surfaced in 1996. That high turnover "is part of the diversity, part of  the excitement," Pearse says. Such changes in species composition  are not evidence of deterioration, he says, but of dynamic  ecosystems.

Pearse's group presented the latest findings of its ongoing  study as a poster at the annual Monterey Bay National Marine  Sanctuary Symposium in March. His coauthors were Eric Danner and  Lani Watson, both graduate students in ocean sciences, and Chela  Zabin, a senior in marine biology. Their poster was named "Best  Overall" at the symposium.

To document changes in the environment, such long-term  studies are essential, says Andrew DeVogelaere, research  coordinator and senior scientist at Monterey Bay National Marine  Sanctuary. "For us, it's a unique data set," he says. "To have a  comparison from 25 years ago on rocky shores is incredible. Most  studies last two to four years."

Rafe Sagarin, a researcher at Stanford University's Hopkins  Marine Station in Pacific Grove, says of Pearse's study, "His work is  really important for looking at this basic but unresearched question  of what's out there--and how it's changing."

Pearse could never have gotten such complete information  without the students who scour the intertidal for its hidden life-forms. His Biology 161L class searches for species at sites  ranging from the north side of Pigeon Point in San Mateo County  south to Pleasure Point between Santa Cruz and Capitola. Clothed in  chest-high waders or wet suits, the group assembles at the site of  the day about an hour before the morning low tide. The students fan  out over the slick rocks for the day's treasure hunt, sometimes  accompanied by several dogs and equipped with clipboards, species  lists from previous visits, field guides, nets, and vials.

Following the tide out, students wade through the iridescent  green-blue seaweed to find and identify the intertidal's myriad of  inhabitants, such as scaled worm snails and brilliant orange  sponges. Some of the most spectacular finds are tiny sea slugs,  called "butterflies of the sea" because of their astonishing colors.  The robin's-egg-blue body of Phidiana crassicornis has neon-blue  racing stripes and is less than an inch long. The brown frill running  the length of its body helps it breathe, explains Jeff Newman, a  junior in biology and environmental studies. He adds, "The early  mornings are rough, but the creatures make it worth it."

Teaching assistant Jay Park has been working on the survey for  four seasons. For him, doing research is the motivation. "We're doing  research that will help us understand what's here in Monterey Bay,"  he says.

Pearse, who came to UCSC in 1971, is regarded as an expert on  Monterey Bay's nearshore ecosystems. A handsome, solidly built man  with graying hair and beard, it's easy to imagine him at the helm of a  ship. But the Sea-Wolf never had Pearse's ready smile--or his  Guatemalan sweatshirt.

"John's an amazing teacher," teaching assistant Katrina Hart  says. "Pretty much any question you have, he'll be able to explain  what's going on."

The class continually discovers new species for each location.  Pearse says, "I didn't anticipate we would have this richness. We  may have an increased number of species, but I don't know that yet."  The researchers must do further analysis to determine whether  there are indeed more species present, or whether the group is just  more experienced at treasure hunting.
