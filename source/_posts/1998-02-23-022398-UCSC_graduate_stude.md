SANTA CRUZ, CA--A graduate student at the University of California, Santa  Cruz, has received the prestigious Newcomb Cleveland Prize from the  American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).

AAAS grants the Newcomb Cleveland Prize to the author or authors of  the outstanding research paper published in the organization's journal,  Science, during the previous year; two related papers were chosen this year.

Arun Kashyap, a UCSC biology student, shared the $5,000 prize and  bronze medal with the other authors of the winning papers.

AAAS presented its 1997-98 awards, including the Newcomb Cleveland  Prize, at the organization's annual meeting in Philadelphia on February 16.

The papers chosen this year were "Small Peptides as Potent Mimetics  of the Protein Hormone Erythropoietin," written by Kashyap and nine others;  and "Functional Mimicry of a Protein Hormone by a Peptide Agonist: The EPO  Receptor Complex at 2.8 Angstrom," authored by nine people.

Published July 26, 1996, the two papers were the product of a  collaborative effort of three research groups: Affymax Research Institute in  Palo Alto, Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, and the Robert Wood  Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute in Raritan, New Jersey. The  paper Kashyap helped write was based on research carried out by Kashyap  and others while he was employed at Affymax.

Kashyap said he feels "very fortunate to not only have worked with  exceptional people resulting in this discovery, but to also have the work  recognized by the AAAS."

In the research described by the papers, the authors developed small  peptides that mimic the effects of erythropoietin (EPO), a large hormone  that helps make red blood cells. The peptides are completely unrelated to  the natural hormone. EPO is sometimes administered intravenously to  chemotherapy patients and by injection to people who suffer from chronic  kidney failure or have low red blood cell counts. The research may lead to  more conveniently administered treatments.
