SANTA CRUZ, CA--Aficionados of the Internet appreciate how  quickly they can send and access information. However, today's  Internet also limits most of its users in one key way: They're tied  down to hardwired workstations, unable to get online on-the-go.  Even wireless modems require users to hook up to the Internet via an  established service provider, such as America Online. If you're out of  range, you're out of luck.

A research team at UC Santa Cruz aims to change all of that.  Led by computer engineer J. J. Garcia-Luna, the team has developed  tools known as WINGs--Wireless INternet Gateways--that allow  users to create their own mobile networks. The portable devices,  which communicate by radio, can spawn roving "Internets" at any  time, anywhere, independent of wires, service providers, or other  electronic middlemen. That flexibility makes WINGs ideal for  emergencies, military situations, and our increasingly nomadic  working culture.

Now, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)  has boosted Garcia-Luna's efforts with two new three-year grants,  totaling more than $2.5 million. One project will extend the team's  work on WINGs by making the devices more secure, adaptive, and  reliable under a variety of mobile conditions. In the second project,  the team will work on a new Internet architecture using "active"  packets, which can modify the behaviors of computers that receive  them.

Most of the funding will support Garcia-Luna's team of  researchers and graduate students at UCSC's Jack Baskin School of  Engineering. About $524,000 will go to Rooftop Communications  Corp. in Los Altos, the main industrial partner in the WINGs  initiative.

At the heart of both projects is the goal of increasing the  flexibility and adaptability of the Internet, which has spread in  recent years like electronic kudzu--and with just about as much  order. Existing networks usually can't handle the demands of a roving  field operation, or even a business executive trying to run his office  from his car, lunch engagement, or plane.

"We're trying to make networking more pervasive and  transparent," Garcia-Luna said. "It will be everywhere, but you won't  know it's there."

WINGs have taken the team a big step in that direction. The  handheld devices and the protocols that run them have attracted the  attention of industrial collaborators, most notably Hughes  Electronics, SRI International, and Bolt Beranek Newman (a  subsidiary of GTE). Each WING can carry out the functions of a  normal Internet "node," such as routing and transferring e-mail and  other information. It uses radio frequencies to talk to its brethren,  creating a mobile community of communication. Garcia-Luna's team  envisions long-range, high-power WINGs that reside in vehicles or on  rooftops, supplemented by handheld, low-power WINGs for users on  the move.

The major new project is called SPARROW (Secure Protocols  for Adaptive, Robust, Reliable, and Opportunistic WINGs). "WINGs  give us one part of the bird," said Garcia-Luna, explaining the  enormous acronym. "We wanted the whole bird."

Security is a major aspect of the endeavor. A mobile network  isn't much good, Garcia-Luna said, if someone can compromise the  information in some way. That's especially true for military  operations, of paramount concern to the funding agency. So, the  SPARROW versions of the portable devices will feature new  protocols to guard against such intrusions.

"The Internet started out with the notion that all of its users  were good citizens," Garcia-Luna said. "But now it's everywhere, and  more and more people have to put locks on their doors."

The team will create devices that can use any of multiple  radio frequencies to communicate. The hardware also will adapt to  different regimes of power levels, bandwidths, numbers of users,  their travel speeds, and other conditions that can vary dramatically  in emergency situations.

"What DARPA wants is a network that is really hard to kill,"  Garcia-Luna said. "If someone jams one frequency, it could switch  instantly to others. It could connect to land links, satellites, or  wired networks. It must be very survivable and very mobile."

The civilian applications of such "Global Mobile Information  Systems," as DARPA calls them, are clear. An instant communication  infrastructure would help rescue teams in disaster areas, where it's  vital to transmit information beyond just words over a two-way  radio. Researchers, other workers, and the rest of us ultimately  could access the Internet or each other through any number of small  mobile nodes, Garcia-Luna said.

The second DARPA-funded project is part of a broad effort to  extend the Internet's base architecture beyond such traditional  methods as IP (Internet Protocol) and ATM (Asynchronous Transfer  Mode). In the Internet today, said Garcia-Luna, changes in  communications protocols can take years. Information packets sent  from place to place are "passive," as in a document to open and read.  But as technology evolves, network protocols will need to change  within months or days.

To foster that environment, Garcia-Luna's team will try to  develop software for active packets--the equivalent, he said, of  network-level "applets" used in Internet Java applications. As their  name implies, active packets can play a role beyond simple  information transfer. They also can contain instructions or programs  that modify the behavior of the Internet node receiving the packet.  The team will focus on how to do this securely, reliably, and under  "multicasting" conditions when many users may communicate and  exchange instructions at the same time.
