UCSC got its 15 minutes of fame in the Dec. 1 issue of the _Aptos Times,_ which featured psychologist **Barbara Rogoff's** work, research on the coastline's shifting sands by geologist **Gary Griggs,** chemist **Phil Crews's** work on marine sponges, and biologist **Gary Silberstein's** finding that a gene linked to the most common abdominal cancer in children may also contribute to the development of breast cancer.

Physicist **Abe Seiden** was featured in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel's_ coverage of UCSC's involvement in an international high-energy particle-physics project based in Switzerland.

UCSC's **Banana Slug memorabilia,** including fuzzy slippers, made _West_ magazine's list of great gifts for holiday giving. The same issue mentioned the **Life Lab Science Program** in an article about the surge of gardens being developed as educational tools at public schools.

In a year-end write-up about the local ag industry, Watsonville's _Register-Pajaronian_ lauded **Chancellor Greenwood's** outreach to local farmers and the appointment of **Carol Shennan** as the new director of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.

In a story about a resurgence of interest in the Vietnam War, the _New York Times_ mentioned several popular classes on the subject offered by universities around the country, including one at UCSC taught by community studies lecturer **Geoffrey Dunn.**

Psychologist **Veronica Tonay's** books about dreaming received favorable notices in the _Sentinel_ and in Bruce Bratton's column in the _Good Times._

Art student **Noah Buchanan** was the focus of a feature story in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel._ A junior, Buchanan recently illustrated a children's book which won an award for excellence from the American Bookseller's Association. Artist **Frank Galuszka,** who has mentored Buchanan this year, was also quoted for the story.
