Agroecology's **Sean Swezey** spoke at a recent fund-raising event at the local Patagonia store at the Sash Mill. In conjunction with National Organic Awareness Month, the event was a fund-raiser for the California Alliance of Family Farmers and was cosponsored by Patagonia. Swezey talked about the production of organic cotton, which is featured in Patagonia products. In partnership with Central Valley farmers, Swezey has pioneered techniques for growing organic cotton.
