title: Psychologists Use Jackie Robinson Story To Make A Pitch For  Affirmative Action In The Workplace

SANTA CRUZ, CA--How do you pitch the importance of affirmative  action to employers who see such policies as glorified quota  systems? Psychology professor Anthony Pratkanis found the answer  on the baseball field.

In 1947, Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball  team and became the first black player to compete in major league  baseball in this century. Pratkanis, a social psychologist at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, says baseball's "great  experiment" also marked the beginning of the first affirmative  action program in human history.

The Jackie Robinson story has value today because it offers a  textbook example of how employers should plan and implement  affirmative action. It also shows how an organization can benefit  from opening its doors--the Dodgers prospered financially and were  perennial contenders for the next ten years in what came to be  known as the Dodgers golden era. Pratkanis, an associate professor  of psychology at UCSC, teamed up with Marlene Turner, an associate  professor of management and organizations at San Jose State  University, to study affirmative action; their findings appear in two  articles in "Nine: A Journal of Baseball History and Social Policy  Perspectives."

"What we've done is describe affirmative action in terms that  a lot of business managers can relate to--sports," says Pratkanis.  "Baseball fans know the Jackie Robinson story, and although most  wouldn't think of it as affirmative action, that's exactly what it  was. We want employers to see that they can do the same thing, so  we're showing them how the Dodgers did it. The principles are  exactly the same."

Pratkanis and Turner define affirmative action as taking  proactive steps to remove discriminatory barriers and to promote  positive relations. Social psychologists have spent 40 years  studying how to make integration work, but Pratkanis and Turner  conclude that Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey, who hired  Robinson, had an intuitive sense of how to integrate the team. For  employers who lack that intuition, Pratkanis and Turner spell out  what it takes to make integration work. Both are avid baseball fans,  and their passion for the game enlivens the articles, which are rich  with anecdotes and humor.

Pratkanis and Turner set the scene in their first article, "The  Year Cool Papa Bell Lost the Batting Title: Mr. Branch Rickey and Mr.  Jackie Robinson's Plea for Affirmative Action," which appears in the  March issue. James "Cool Papa" Bell deliberately lost the Negro  Major Leagues batting title in 1946 to call attention to a younger  player, Monte Irvin, at a time when the major leagues were for the  first time considering signing black players. "It was important  (Irvin) be noticed, important he get that chance," Bell explained  later.

In the second article, titled "Nine Principles of Successful  Affirmative Action: Mr. Branch Rickey, Mr. Jackie Robinson, and the  Integration of Baseball," Pratkanis and Turner present numerous  anecdotes to show the care with which Rickey pursued his goal.  Rickey first signed Robinson to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers' top  farm club in Montreal in 1946 and then called him up to play for the  Dodgers a year later. The article, which will appear in the September  issue, illustrates the nine principles that Pratkanis and Turner  identify as essential elements of a successful affirmative action  program:

1\. Create the psychology that change is inevitable--Rickey  provided strong leadership, and his efforts won over key  individuals, such as Dodgers announcer Red Barber. Rickey  confided in Barber about his plans two years before he hired  Robinson because he knew that to succeed he would need the  support of the "voice of the Dodgers." A native southerner, Barber's  initial reaction was that he would rather quit than work for a team  with a black player, but he came to subscribe to the "psychology of  the inevitable."

2\. Establish equal status and common goals--Rickey was privy  to the work of social scientists such as Dan Dodson, a New  York University sociologist, who assured Rickey that the  common goal of winning the pennant would overwhelm racist  attitudes and unify team members.

3\. Puncture the "norm of prejudice"--The presence of even one  dissenter can shatter the power of group pressure.  Dodgers shortstop Harold "Pee Wee" Reese is credited on his  Hall of Fame plaque with being "instrumental in easing acceptance of  Jackie Robinson as baseball's first black performer."

4\. Practice nonviolent resistance--When Rickey hired  Robinson, he knew he was getting a fine ballplayer, but he  wanted a player "with guts enough not to fight back." Robinson met  the test, adhering to a strict code of nonviolence despite enormous  pressure. Nonviolence prevents violence from escalating and  shows an irrevocable commitment to change.

5\. Create empathy--Robinson's teammates saw firsthand the  insults and discrimination that he experienced. Witnessing the  abuse helped bring the team together as white players came to  Robinson's defense.

6\. Reduce "tokenism"--Being reduced to token status can erode  an individual's confidence and intensify scrutiny of his or her  behavior. Rickey relied on sportswriters to "introduce" Robinson  to the public and to highlight his athletic accomplishments rather  than his skin color. By mid-season of 1947, writers often  ignored Robinson's race.

7\. Offer forgiveness and redemption--Rickey was a keen judge  of character who never hesitated to reward individuals whose  attitudes changed in a positive way. Dodgers catcher Bobby Bragan,  who initially opposed the hiring of Robinson but went on to coach  black ballplayers in the Dodgers farm system, was grateful that  Rickey saw his potential to change.

8\. Undo the perception of preferential selection--Rickey and  his assistants were careful to counter the charge that  Robinson was hired for his color rather than his talent (see below).

9\. Identify and remove institutional barriers--After Rickey  hired Robinson, he held spring training in Havana, Cuba,  because many small American towns had segregated housing and  dining facilities. Cuba is a racially desegregated country.

The authors describe Rickey's deft handling of Dodgers players  who asked to be traded or threatened to strike rather than play with  Robinson, and they show the process of team-building that took  place as players bonded and the team became more cohesive. "The  question I'd ask business managers today is 'Can you manage your  affirmative action program like Dodgers manager Branch Rickey did?  Can you take your affirmative action program to the World Series?'"  says Pratkanis.

Because affirmative action today carries the stigma of being a  quota program rather than help for those who are discriminated  against, Pratkanis and Turner also offer employers additional advice  on how to counter the perception that an employee did not earn his  or her position. Again, they use Rickey's strategy to illustrate their  guidelines: Establish explicit qualifications criteria (the box score);  ensure that selection procedures are perceived as fair (Robinson  paid his dues in the minors); prove competence (Robinson's season  with the Montreal farm club); emphasize the individual's  contributions (Dodgers officials claimed Robinson would get the  team in the pennant race); strategize to avoid feelings of  helplessness (the minor leagues helped build Robinson's confidence);  reinforce that affirmative action is not preferential selection  (Rickey told Robinson he would have to make it on his own); and keep  attention focused on the social barriers preventing integration (the  color bar in baseball).

As a devout Christian, Rickey wanted to correct the social  injustice of segregation. But he also saw other benefits of breaking  the color bar. "The year before Rickey hired Robinson, there was a  secret vote at an owners meeting that went 15-1 against  desegregating baseball. Rickey was the sole dissenter," says  Pratkanis. "Most people thought black players would ruin the game  forever. But Rickey saw the advantages way before anyone else did.  He knew it would open up an untapped reservoir of talent that would  make the Dodgers winners, and he knew it would mean big money at  the gates. A lot of times we don't see the advantages of integration."

Pratkanis sees similar advantages of affirmative action for  employers. "There's lots of talent out there that just needs a break.  What we're doing is asking people to take leadership positions, just  like Mr. Rickey did," says Pratkanis. "Rickey's nine principles are as  valid today as they were then."
