The _Sacramento Bee_ and the _San Jose Mercury News_ called on researcher **Dave Garrison** of the Institute of Marine Sciences for comment upon the oceanic algal blooms known as red tides. Warmer coastal water, triggered by El Nino, may make red tides more widespread this fall and winter, Garrison said.

Biochemist **Jody Puglisi,** late of UCSC and now at Stanford, was a key part of a large article on antibiotic resistance in the _Dallas Morning News._ The article described work in Puglisi's UCSC lab to determine the structure of a complex between an antibiotic molecule and the piece of a bacteria that it jams. The _Seattle Times_ also printed the story.
