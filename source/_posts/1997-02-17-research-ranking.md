title: UCSC Ranks 11th In New National Assessment Of Research Universities

In a comprehensive new analysis of more than 200 top  universities, UCSC ranks 11th in  the nation among public campuses in the  quality of its research productivity. The study and rankings are  detailed in a just-published book that chronicles the rise of  a new generation of postwar research universities in the United States.

The book, _The Rise of American Research  Universities: Elites and Challengers in the Postwar Era_ (Johns  Hopkins University Press, 1996), makes the case that some of this  country's newer research campuses are challenging many of the  so-called "elite" universities in the quality of their research activities.

The authors, historians Hugh Davis Graham of Vanderbilt  University and Nancy Diamond of the University of Maryland, assessed the  performance of 203 research universities from 1945 to 1990. For  the study, they measured per capita faculty research  productivity--the creation of new knowledge--in everything from  medical science to the classics.

"Although there are fewer surprises among the private  universities, in the public system some dramatic rising stars  are found," Graham said. "Universities such as Ohio State and  Penn State that traditionally enjoyed strong reputations were not  among the top performers."

UCSC, according to the survey, was.

The campus's overall  ranking of 11th in the nation among public universities includes a No. 1 ranking in the  survey's Social Science Index  and No. 6 in the Arts and Humanities Index.

The numerical indexes used to measure productivity  were: money received from federal grants, number of articles published  in all fields, articles in top-rated scientific and social  science journals, and fellowships in the arts and humanities.

"Surveys such as those conducted by the National Research  Council and the American Council on Education use reputational data  to measure productivity," Graham said. "This creates a halo  effect, especially for the large institutions, which leads to the selection  of the same elites, year after year."

Chancellor Greenwood calls the study the  most important of its kind in decades. "Obviously, I'm thrilled  by the ranking of UC Santa Cruz in this study. But I believe  this analysis is also proof positive that the California  Master Plan for Higher Education has worked," the chancellor  said. "In the span of 30 years in California, we have progressed  from having one or two recognized research campuses to enjoying the  benefits of a handful of high-quality research campuses, of which  UC Santa Cruz is one."

The authors supported that view, giving high marks to  states like California that have designated certain schools as  research institutions and supported them accordingly. Too often, they  said, states try to level the playing field by considering  almost all public universities as research institutions, which dilutes support.

California's 1960 master plan designated specific  roles for the state's three branches of higher education: the  University of California, California State University, and Community  College systems. The master plan gave the UC system exclusive  responsibility for research activities and doctoral degrees.
