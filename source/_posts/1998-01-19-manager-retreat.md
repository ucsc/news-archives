title: Managers Participate In First-Of-Its-Kind Retreat

The newly established Administrative Council invited unit managers and  supervisors from across the campus to a "leadership convocation" at Stevenson  College last week. The half-day informational session on January 13,  attended by some 200 managers, was the first event of its kind held  specifically for campus managers.

The retreat was organized to foster a "common understanding" of the  issues facing the campus and the efforts under way or needed to meet  those challenges, observed Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, who opened the  morning with a talk titled "Fiat Lux: Defining Our Values and Partners for the  Future."

Repeating a primary theme of her  administration, the chancellor said the  quality and viability of UCSC's programs will increasingly rely on the  campus's success at fostering additional public and private partnerships. "The  mantra for our future will be how can we help each other," she added.

Chaired by  Executive Vice Chancellor Michael Tanner, the Administrative  Council was titled the Change  Management Team the past four years and operated in  an ad-hoc capacity; renamed this month, the Administrative  Council will provide ongoing advice to the chancellor  and EVC. Other members include Tom  Vani, vice chancellor for Business and Administrative  Services (BAS); Francisco  Hernandez, vice chancellor for Student Affairs; Richard Jensen, associate  chancellor for Planning and Budget; Julia Armstrong-Zwart, assistant  chancellor for Human Resources; and Leslie Sunell, executive assistant to the  chancellor.

In addition to the chancellor, the following members of the senior  administration made informational presentations at the retreat:
* Hernandez, who spoke about the rapid  transformations units on campus will  need to make to accommodate the next "tidal wave" of students. "We need to  plan, and we need to plan to change, while retaining our twin goals of  diversity and excellence," he said.
* Tanner, who spoke about the challenge of developing tomorrow's  curriculum, integrating subjects that are critical for society's evolution with  those that students demand. As a knowledge-based activity, he added,  "information technology will be key to the generation and dissemination of  knowledge."
* Armstrong-Zwart, who spoke of the challenge of attracting, retaining,  and retooling a skilled workforce. The campus, she also said, must still travel  some distance before its workforce represents the diversity of the labor pool.
* Karen Eckert, budget director, who stressed the diverse fund sources  that support UCSC's range of expenditures. In today's budget climate, she  added, it has become critical that the campus educate and train managers to  become "leveragers" of new resources--support that will be essential to  maintain existing programs and develop new ones.
* Vani, who discussed the rationale for systems of financial management  and controls and offered a historical look at UCSC's physical planning. In  addition to outlining the principles behind the physical development of the  campus, Vani described a capital budget that, if forecasts prove correct, will  fall far short of need.
* Marc Mangel, a professor of environmental studies and cochair of the  Millennium Committee, who challenged managers to seriously consider how  the campus's development, transmission, and application of knowledge can  be done "more effectively" and "more nimbly."
* Martin Chemers, dean of social sciences, who employed his background  in leadership psychology to discuss the  characteristics of a thriving--and surviving--organization.  "We have to somehow find this common vision...to think collectively about  the mission of the whole organization and the best way to achieve it," he said.

At the close of the convocation, the managers  broke into small groups to  discuss questions about planning and growth, communication, technology,  vision, and financial management. In the days and weeks that follow the  January 13 retreat, the groups are to meet and continue discussions on  their assigned topics.

Representatives of the small groups are scheduled to make their reports  at a retreat follow-up meeting on February 4.

Linda Kittle, who chaired the planning team that developed the retreat,  said organizers are also exploring ways to disseminate the presentations to  the broader campus audience.

In addition to Kittle, the planning team comprises Sharon Cohen Barry of Human Resources, Catherine Faris of BAS, Sheila Gottehrer of the Ombudsman's Office, Gail Heit of Student Affairs, Ernie Hudson of the Executive Vice Chancellor's Office, and Keith Muscutt of the Arts Division.
