## UC Santa Cruz Nets Two Major Grants To Increase Child Care Services For Low-income Student Families

SANTA CRUZ, CA--August was a good month for Child Care Services at the University of California, Santa Cruz. First, the program was selected as one of a small group of institutions across the country to receive recently established federal child care grants. The grant enables them to expand their enrollment of the infants and toddlers of low-income UCSC student parents. On the heels of that announcement, made by Vice President Al Gore, the program received news of an additional grant for the Infant and Toddler Program from the California Department of Education, Child Development Division.

The federal grant comes through the U.S. Department of Education's Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CAMPUS) Program. The program was established through the Higher Education 1998 Federal Child Care Act to support the participation of more low-income parents in the postsecondary system by establishing or expanding campus-based child care programs.

The CAMPUS grant was announced August 16 by Gore, who named UCSC as one of 87 colleges and universities to receive this first round of grants. From a funding pool of $4.9 million, UCSC received $55,937, which constitutes 21 percent of the Infant and Toddler Program's budget. An additional $210,372 of the budget comes from other sources. Awards ranged between $50,000 and $200,000. UCSC will receive the grant each year for the next four years.

"No parent should have to choose between taking care of their children and furthering their education," Gore said. "These grants will help us support low-income Americans who want to work hard and get the education and training they need to improve their skills and their chance to build a better future for themselves and their family."

The second grant, from the California Department of Education, will provide $67,150 annually on an ongoing basis for subsidized care for low-income parents.

"We're thrilled," said Lise Bixler, director of Child Care Services. "There is a long waiting list for infant and toddler care, and year-round care is needed as welfare reform measures place increased pressure on low-income students to work and graduate quickly. The grants make it possible for us to double the number of spaces for infants and toddlers to 18, expand from an academic-year-only to a year-round program, and to provide 14 subsidized spaces for low-income students."

Three child care programs, currently licensed for a total of 69 children, are operated by UCSC and are located at the campus's Family Student Housing facilities. These programs provide support services to student families with children. Among those services are quality care for children; education and training in child development; referrals to community resources; and coordination and connection with the various units and services of the university. The Infant and Toddler Program and Child Development Program are accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children.

A fourth program for preschool-aged children, located at the historic Granary building on campus, is operated by an independent contractor, Child Development Centers, and serves UCSC staff, faculty, students, and the community. The Granary Child Development Center has been awarded a grant of $65,000 from the California Department of Education to provide a State Preschool Program. This funding will provide free part-time child care to low-income parents who qualify. Some additional subsidies are available for full-day care at the Granary.
