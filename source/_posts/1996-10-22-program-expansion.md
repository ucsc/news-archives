**New Degree Offerings In Electrical Engineering And Applied  Mathematics Will Pave The Way For A Future School Of Engineering,  Ucsc's First Professional School**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A commitment of $2 million from the University  of California Office of the President will help UC Santa Cruz launch  a long-planned and ambitious expansion of its engineering programs,  priming the campus to increase its contributions to the economy of  the region and the state's high-technology industry.

UC President Richard C. Atkinson confirmed the funding in a  letter last week to Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood of UCSC. The campus  will use the funds to hire sixteen faculty members during the next  three to four years, starting in the fall of 1997. These hires will  lead to new departments in two key disciplines: electrical  engineering and applied and engineering mathematics. UCSC will  recruit the first freshmen into the electrical engineering program  for matriculation next September.

The new researchers and course offerings will significantly  enhance UCSC's existing degree programs in computer engineering  and computer science. They also represent crucial steps toward the  establishment of a School of Engineering--the first professional  school in UCSC's history. Among the additional bachelors, masters,  and Ph.D. programs being considered for this school are  biotechnology engineering, environmental engineering,  manufacturing engineering, applied mechanics, engineering  management, and mechanical engineering.

"I want to extend my best wishes to you and your colleagues on  the engineering initiatives," President Atkinson wrote in his letter.  "I believe that Santa Cruz is positioning itself to serve California  well in this vital area of teaching, research, and service."

Chancellor Greenwood has announced that UCSC will now strive  to augment the funds from the Office of the President with  contributions from industry and the private sector. "We will begin  building toward what we know will be a distinctive 21st-century  School of Engineering," Greenwood says. "Following in the Santa Cruz  tradition of the past, it will be innovative and synergistic, with  vital research and educational interactions across many disciplines.  It also will provide a huge boost to our abilities to educate students  to meet the changing demands of society."

Greenwood also announced that Patrick Mantey, Jack Baskin  Professor of Computer Engineering at UCSC, will serve as associate  dean for engineering within UCSC's Natural Sciences Division.  Mantey, who came to Santa Cruz from IBM in 1984 as the first  chairman of the Computer Engineering Department, will oversee all  aspects of the engineering expansion.

"With a professional School of Engineering, we will fulfill our  dream that the Santa Cruz campus can become a much more  important player in the economy of Silicon Valley, the region, and  the state," Mantey says. "We are the University of California campus  closest to Silicon Valley, and we have a special opportunity to serve  the Silicon Valley population. We have shown with our computer  science and computer engineering programs that we can respond to  the needs of the region, but now we will be able to do so in a much  more mature and diverse way."

Ten of the initial faculty hires will be within electrical  engineering and six within applied and engineering mathematics.  They will affiliate with existing campus units until enough hires  have occurred to create new departments. With future new hires and  existing faculty, UCSC's School of Engineering will be comparable in  terms of numbers of students and faculty to other excellent and  focused engineering programs across the nation, Mantey says.

The school's researchers and students will engage in  multidisciplinary work that capitalizes on UCSC's existing strengths  in areas such as environmental studies, economics, physics, biology,  chemistry and biochemistry, ocean sciences, and earth sciences.  Indeed, a formal proposal from a faculty committee to establish a  School of Engineering, issued in 1991, identified such collaborations  as likely hallmarks of a Santa Cruz professional school.

"The enlightened uses of [new] technologies are most likely to  be achieved if engineers are provided a broad and diversified  education in the arts, humanities, and social sciences," the report  stated. "UCSC's traditional emphasis upon quality liberal education  will be even more valuable as we enter a new and highly  technological century."

Faculty across campus are enthusiastic to see their careful  plans for a School of Engineering finally bearing fruit. Professor of  chemistry and biochemistry Eugene Switkes, who chaired the  thirteen-member committee that prepared the 1991 proposal, says  the students themselves will be among the most important  beneficiaries.

"We believe that students who come here for engineering  programs will bring an intellectual richness to the entire campus  community," Switkes says. "One can imagine a pre-engineering  student debating with a philosophy student in a literature class."  Engineering students will serve to even further diversify the social  and economic backgrounds of the student body, he adds.

Improvements to the Applied Sciences Building, which now  houses the Departments of Computer Engineering, Computer Science,  and Mathematics, will provide space for new faculty offices,  research laboratories, and teaching laboratories.
