SANTA CRUZ, CA--Robert Kraft and Jerry Nelson, astronomers at  UCO/Lick Observatory and the University of California, Santa Cruz,  have earned two of the top awards in astronomy for their visionary  work in the field.

Kraft, a professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics,  was named Henry Norris Russell Lecturer for 1995 by the American  Astronomical Society (AAS). Nelson, a professor of astronomy and  astrophysics, received the 1995 Dannie Heineman Prize for  Astrophysics from the AAS and the American Institute of Physics.  Both men will deliver prize lectures at an upcoming meeting of the  AAS. In addition, Nelson's award carries a $7,500 cash prize.

The Russell Lectureship recognizes lifetime achievement in  astronomy. The annual award was first given in 1946 to Henry Norris  Russell, an astronomer at Princeton University who pioneered  modern astrophysics in this country. The AAS award committee  chose Kraft for his influential studies of variable stars, exploding  stars known as novae, stellar rotation, and the chemical properties  of the oldest stars in the Milky Way. Kraft's award citation reads, in  part, "His profound insight, together with the rigor and breadth of  his research, has greatly advanced our understanding of the history,  structure, and content of the galaxy."

Kraft came to UCSC in 1967. He headed Lick Observatory as  acting director for brief periods in the late 1960s and early 1970s  and as director from 1981 to 1991. He was president of the AAS  from 1974 to 1976 and is now president-elect of the International  Astronomical Union. Kraft is a member of both the National Academy  of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He  retired from the UCSC faculty in 1992 but maintains an active  research program.

The Heineman Prize, first awarded in 1980, recognizes  distinguished work in astrophysics. The Heineman Foundation for  Research, Educational, Charitable, and Scientific Purposes funds the  award. Dannie Heineman was an American engineer and  philanthropist who headed SOFINA, a company that developed and  managed public utilities in Europe, the Near East, and South America.  Nelson's prize certificate cites his leading role in conceiving the W.  M. Keck Telescope in Hawaii, the world's largest optical telescope.  "His energy, enthusiasm, intelligence, and deep knowledge of all  aspects of the physics and engineering were essential to the  successful completion of the Keck Telescopes on Mauna Kea, the  first of the new generation," the award citation reads.

Nelson joined the UCSC faculty in 1994 after many years at UC  Berkeley. He gained renown as the principal designer and project  scientist for the Keck Telescope and its twin, Keck II, now under  construction. Nelson's design of 36 hexagonal segments aligned to  act as one 400-inch mirror has revolutionized ground-based  astronomy. Nelson and others are working on an adaptive-optics  system for the telescopes, which would cancel the blurring effects  of earth's atmosphere.
