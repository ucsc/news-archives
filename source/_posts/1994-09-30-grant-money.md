SANTA CRUZ, CA--Faculty and staff at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, received $32.4 million in contracts and grants for  research last year, an increase of 4.8 percent from the amount  received the previous year. Public and private grants are included in  the annual total reported by UCSC's Contracts and Grants Office.

The 1993-94 year marked the campus's twelfth consecutive  year of growth in research funding. The campus received $30.8  million in contracts and grants in 1992-93. Public and private  grants are included in the annual total reported by UCSC's Contracts  and Grants Office.

"This growth is likely to continue," said James Gill, associate  vice chancellor for research and professor of earth sciences at  UCSC. "The campus success rate continues to be high. The dollar  value of proposals submitted has doubled in the last four years,  reflecting the increased level of research and graduate programs on  the campus."

A total of 448 awards were received this past year, compared  to 421 awards earned the previous year. Principal funders include  the National Science Foundation ($8.1 million), the National  Institutes of Health ($4.5 million), the Office of Naval Research  ($3.6 million), the U.S. Department of Education ($2.3 million), the  U.S. Department of Energy ($1.9 million), and the California  Department of Fish and Game ($1.1 million).

Grants directly support research projects at UCSC, including  the majority of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers on  campus, said Gill. In addition, contracts and grants make up a  significant portion of the campus's annual budget. In 1993-94, the  total campus budget was $196.7 million, of which major components  included $84.4 million in state funds, $32.4 million in contracts and  grants, and $28.5 million in student registration and education fees.  Gill also noted that the bulk of contract and grant funding goes  toward salaries, which are spent in Santa Cruz. "This is an example  of how support for the university translates into support for the  local community," he said.
