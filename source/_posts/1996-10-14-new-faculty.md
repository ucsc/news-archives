**Marc Mangel**

Professor of Environmental Studies  

Marc Mangel comes to UCSC from UC Davis, where he was director of the Center for Population Biology. Mangel focuses on the ecological implications of natural variation within populations of organisms. "It's essential that natural scientists and environmental scientists work together to solve environmental problems," says Mangel. He has spent many years studying the life-history variations of Atlantic salmon, and he plans to examine similar questions regarding steelhead trout along California's central coast. He has also studied "fruit flies of economic importance," including the Medfly and the apple maggot, and now plans to study butterflies, which also damage plants by laying eggs that hatch and eat their host plant.

**JoAnn Woodsum**

Assistant Professor of American Studies  

JoAnn Woodsum studies Native North American history including native gender systems, legal constructions of Indian identity, and contemporary Native American art. Woodsum comes to UCSC from the Women's Studies Program at Dartmouth College where she was a visiting scholar and instructor. She has held a number of fellowships, including one with the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. Before entering graduate school, Woodsum worked as a lawyer for five years in San Francisco. She earned her B.A. in U.S. history from Dartmouth College and her J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. She is currently completing her Ph.D. in history from UCLA.
