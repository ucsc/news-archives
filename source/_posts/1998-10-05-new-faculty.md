**Helen Shapiro**  
Associate Professor of Sociology

As an economist, Helen Shapiro specializes in the economic development of less-developed countries. Her focus is on Latin America--specifically Brazil--and Mexico and the interactions of states and multinational corporations. "With globalization, is there even room for state policies to influence the direction of economic development, or can multinationals do whatever they want?" asked Shapiro, whose book detailed the origins of the Brazilian automotive industry. She teaches courses in sociology, economics, and Latin American and Latino studies. Shapiro has an M.A., M.Phil., and Ph.D. from Yale Univesity. She came to UCSC from the Harvard Business School, where she taught for eight years.
