**University Of Natal Professor Martin Prozesky Has Been Active In The Formation Of Constitutional And Governmental Policies Defining The Role Of Religion In The New Order**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Throughout its history, the conservative  government of South Africa often cited the Bible as the basis of its  system of apartheid. Now that the fledgling democratic government  is taking shape, Martin Prozesky wants to make sure that the same  mistake is not repeated twice.

"This is our first chance in a 300-year history to institute  some justice concerning religion," say Prozesky, a senior academic  figure in South Africa who has spent much of his career lobbying for  the separation of church and state in his home country.

Prozesky will speak on the role of religion in the new South  Africa in two upcoming talks at the University of California, Santa  Cruz. The first talk is titled "Universities, Politics, and  Reconstruction in the New South Africa," and takes place on Tuesday,  October 11, from 5 to 6:30 p.m. The second talk, titled "Conscience  of the Nation? Religion in South Africa after Apartheid," takes place  Thursday, October 13, from 5 to 6:30 p.m. Both talks will be  presented in the Stevenson Fireside Lounge. They are free and open  to the public.

The author of a number of books on religion and the role of  religion in apartheid, Prozesky observes that, "We had a situation  here where there was religious justification for apartheid, where  people found ways of reading into the Bible that the creator made  people different and that meant mixing could not be allowed. The  new government is taking a very different kind of stance, but the  really important issue is that we have an interim new constitution  that has to be finalized in the next two years. It's essential that the  constitutional status of religion be finalized as a separation of  religion and state."

A professor of religion and dean of humanities at the  University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg, Prozesky has been a  longtime advocate of the separation of church and state. He was  recently part of a successful effort to establish a policy that will  change religious programming on the taxpayer-supported South  African Broadcasting Corporation, which previously broadcast  heavily Christian-oriented programming.

Prozesky, who has acted as a consultant for the World  Congress on Religion and Peace, has brought this issue to the  attention of the public through numerous opinion pieces in papers  and journals. He has lobbied officials and has even enlisted the help  of Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

Although Prozesky says that there is support in South African  government for the separation of church and state (opening prayers  for each session of Parliament were abolished after elections last  April), the majority of the country may not be in agreement. Sixty- six percent of South Africans are Christian, according to a 1992  census. Prozesky says that schools not only open with a prayer, but  require religious instruction as part of the curriculum.

"This is a country where there's never been much discussion  about things you take for granted, such as a constitutional  amendment protecting the separation of church and state. I am  hopeful that if we get the constitution right, everything else will  follow," he says.

Prozesky's talks are sponsored by UCSC's Humanities Division.  For more information, call (408) 459-2696.
