SANTA CRUZ, CA--Two members of the National Academy of  Sciences will address some of the hottest topics in the emerging  field of "astrobiology" during a special afternoon colloquium next  week at UC Santa Cruz. The event will run from 4 to 6 p.m. Thursday,  October 30, at the Performing Arts Second Stage (formerly the  Concert Hall). It is free and open to the public.

Speakers are Norman Pace, professor of plant and microbial  biology at UC Berkeley, and Richard Zare, professor of chemistry at  Stanford University. Pace, an expert on the evolution of microbes on  Earth, will speak on "Biological Perspectives on the Origin and  Distribution of Life in the Solar System." Zare, chairman of the  National Science Board and part of a team of scientists that found  possible evidence of ancient life in a Martian meteorite, will  discuss "Mars, Meteorites, and the Meaning of Life." Each speaker  will take questions after his talk.

Astrobiology is a nascent interdisciplinary field that spans  research areas as diverse as astronomy, evolutionary and molecular  biology, chemistry, earth sciences, marine sciences, and physics. A  particular focus of astrobiology concerns the origin and evolution of  life on Earth and, possibly, elsewhere. Work by scientists on such  questions will help us understand how life can evolve and thrive in  extreme environments such as submarine hydrothermal vents, said  colloquium organizer David Deamer, research professor of chemistry  and biochemistry at UCSC.

The colloquium also will serve to focus the interests of UCSC  researchers in creating an astrobiology center, under the aegis of a  proposed national headquarters in astrobiology at the NASA Ames  Research Center in Mountain View. The UCSC center, Deamer said,  would coordinate programs in astrobiology throughout the UC  system. Scientists at NASA Ames and UCSC have worked together  during the last year to identify areas in which the two institutions  could collaborate.

Within a few years, Deamer noted, NASA hopes to devote about  $15 million per year to research topics related to astrobiology.
