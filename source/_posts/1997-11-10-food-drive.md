Sorority members will deliver 35 empty barrels to UCSC on November 12, heralding the start of this year's Second Harvest Food Bank food drive.

"We look forward to a most successful season, as the need continues to grow every year to put food in our neighborhoods' food pantries," said Carol Lacey of the Chancellor's Office.

Volunteers from Alpha Kappa Delta Phi and Sigma Omicron Pi Zeta will leave the barrels at the colleges and in public areas such as the McHenry Library foyer and the Cowell Student Health Center lobby. They will pick up the barrels and any donations the week of December 12.

On Tuesday, November 18, and Wednesday, November 19, volunteers will disburse peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches and milk to students, faculty, and staff who donate whatever amount of money they would normally spend on lunch.

The sandwiches will be distributed from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at College Eight, Merrill College, Social Sciences 1, McHenry Library, the Cowell Student Health Center, the Bay Tree Bookstore parking lot, and at the patio area of Science Hill.

For the second year, Marriott will donate the bread, peanut butter, jelly, and serving utensils for the sandwich giveaways.

Second Harvest accepts donations in the form of checks as well as nonperishable food. The food bank can buy $13.42 worth of canned goods with each dollar donated, Lacey said.

A community nonprofit organization, Second Harvest distributes the donations it receives to needy people throughout the year--through soup kitchens, shelters, and emergency pantries in Santa Cruz and San Benito Counties.
