**UCSC's Role Will Center On The Construction Of Two Giant Particle Detectors**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--About a dozen physicists, engineers, and technicians from  the University of California, Santa Cruz, are among those who will  participate in an international scientific collaboration to build a new high- energy particle accelerator and associated detectors near Geneva,  Switzerland.

Officials with the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science  Foundation today (Monday, December 8) signed an agreement to invest more  than $500 million over the next eight years in the new particle accelerator,  the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), to be built at the European Particle Physics  Laboratory, known by its French initials, CERN. The U.S. is one of several  non-European nations participating in the project, including Japan, Canada,  and Russia. The tab for the project is expected to total more than $6 billion.

Physicists will use the LHC for the next generation of experiments to  explore the fundamental nature of matter, said UCSC physics professor  Abraham Seiden, who will participate in the project.

The LHC will consist of giant magnets, a circular tunnel 16 miles in  circumference, and powerful particle detectors. It will be used to smash  together protons to create even tinier particles. Physicists hope to  approximate the conditions that existed less than one-billionth of a second  after the Big Bang that created the universe.

Seiden, director of UCSC's Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics  (SCIPP), noted that the LHC will generate higher energy collisions than those  produced by any other particle accelerator--about seven times the energy of  the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermilab Tevatron near Chicago.

UCSC's physicists, including research physicist Alex Grillo and adjunct  professor Hartmut Sadrozinski, will join Seiden as members of one of the  two large international collaborations of scientists working on the  construction of the two particle detectors, known as the ATLAS (A Toroidal  LHC Apparatus) and CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) detectors. The two  detectors are the major particle detectors that will operate at the Large  Hadron Collider at CERN. About 20 percent of the physicists involved in the  project are from the U.S., noted Seiden, and the collaborations share the  common goal of exploring the mysteries that underlie the basic building  blocks of matter and the forces acting on them.

The ATLAS and CMS detectors will occupy different locations on the  circumference of the 16-mile accelerator ring. At the center of each  detector, beams of high-energy protons from the LHC will collide head on,  creating about a billion proton-proton collisions each second. The detectors  will measure the energies, directions, and identities of the particles that  fly off from each of these collisions. Computers will process the resulting  information fast enough to select and record only the one-in-10-million  collisions that might carry the seeds of a new discovery, said Seiden.

Although the detectors will be the size of five-story buildings, each  one will have sensors capable of measuring particle trajectories to better  than one-thousandth of an inch, along with other devices that can precisely  measure the amounts of energy carried by collision products flying off in  every direction. Each detector will have large superconducting magnets to  deflect electrically charged collision products and devices to measure their  curving tracks. The detectors will be designed to withstand years of  exposure to the intense radiation that exists at the center of such particle  collisions.

Through SCIPP, the UCSC team will help construct the most precise,  innermost particle detection devices for the ATLAS experiment. UCSC  physicists have earned an international reputation for their expertise  creating detectors made of large, very thin silicon crystals that enable  information to be gathered, stored, and distributed via UCSC-designed  microchips. "It's kind of like having a little computer on there," said Seiden.
