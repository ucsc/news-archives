SANTA CRUZ, CA--The well-being of the Monterey Bay environment,  from the mountaintops to the ocean floor, is the focus of a broad  new program based at UC Santa Cruz known as Monterey Bay Regional  Studies (MBRS).

Researchers at UCSC created the program, pronounced  "embers," to help draw dividends from the region's remarkable  wealth of natural and social scientists. Under the auspices of MBRS,  teams of students and faculty will cross disciplinary lines to study  scientific issues and their consequences--such as the restoration of  Fort Ord, the effects of farming on Elkhorn Slough, and the history  and future of the bay's fisheries.

The program's early stages at UCSC will feature a new course,  a daylong symposium, and "demonstration projects" to test the  multidisciplinary approach. Ultimately, MBRS planners envision a  baywide network of researchers working together on studies that  scientists from any one discipline would find daunting.

"It's logical that MBRS start at UCSC--we have strong and  diverse programs in both marine and terrestrial research, as well as  in the social sciences," says professor of biology Laurel Fox,  director of MBRS. "We've been saying for years that the strength of  UCSC is its location, in this unique and rich coastal zone. This is one  way to take advantage of that strength."

Chancellor Karl S. Pister of UCSC has recognized the potential  of MBRS by committing funds to some of its programs. Faculty  members associated with MBRS are seeking grants from other  agencies, both regionally and nationally, to bolster their efforts.

At a workshop last year, participants from about twenty area  institutions agreed that MBRS was a worthy pursuit. Their chosen  theme, "bidirectional interactions in coastal environments," reflects  the complex interplay of land, sea, and air in the region. It also  acknowledges the influence that humans have upon the bay's natural  systems--none of which remain pristine.

"Our region is undergoing massive transformations," says Fox.  "The growing number of people affects land use, habitats, the sea-- virtually everything in the environment. The coastline represents a  filter to these natural and social processes, rather than a barrier."

The workshop served as a starting point for researchers at  various agencies to talk more with each other about their work. To  get MBRS fired up in a formal way, participants advised that UCSC  take the lead in creating its initial programs. In response, Fox and  her colleagues have planned the following:
* A spring-quarter seminar for graduate students and  advanced undergraduates at UCSC on marine and environmental  issues, such as fisheries, the effects of ecotourism on the bay, and  the impacts of agriculture on the region. Professor of marine  sciences Mary Silver and associate professor of environmental  studies Margaret FitzSimmons will teach the course.
* A one-day symposium in the spring focusing on Monterey  Bay's fisheries. Invited speakers will explore how global climate  changes may affect coastal fisheries, including their history in the  region and their regulation. The symposium will be free and open to  the public; a date and time will be announced later this month.
* Three demonstration projects to begin in July. Funding from  Chancellor Pister will provide seed money for the projects and  financial support for graduate student researchers. One possible  topic is the dynamics and management of maritime chaparral  habitats, including hundreds of acres of relatively unspoiled land at  Fort Ord. Researchers also plan to increase their involvement at  Elkhorn Slough, where investigators from many agencies are  exploring the effects of farming practices on the slough's delicate  marshes and wildlife.

MBRS faculty and students at UCSC also have started a monthly  series of informal gatherings to discuss topics of mutual interest.  For instance, speakers at a March 7 meeting on "perceptions of  nature" included wildlife biologist James Estes, geographer Margaret  FitzSimmons, and politics expert Ronnie Lipschutz.

"We now have a critical mass of faculty committed to  multidisciplinary research," says Fox. "MBRS will be a focus for our  interactions, and it will help us to meet our responsibilities to the  Monterey Bay region."
