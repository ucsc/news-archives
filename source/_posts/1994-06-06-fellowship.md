SANTA CRUZ, CA--The National Science Foundation (NSF) has  awarded prestigious graduate fellowships to twelve students and  recent alumni at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

NSF granted 950 graduate research fellowships and 150  minority graduate fellowships to students who will pursue careers  in science, social science, mathematics, or engineering. About one of  every seven applicants earned a fellowship. "These programs honor  the future leaders who are essential to maintaining the scientific  and technological enterprise that undergirds the economic strength  and well-being of this country," says Luther Williams, assistant  director for education and human resources at NSF. He notes that  twelve recipients have gone on to earn Nobel Prizes.

Each fellowship provides a stipend of $14,400 per year for  full-time graduate study, plus an annual cost-of-education  allowance of $8,600 in lieu of all tuition and fees at U.S.  institutions. The fellowships cover three years of study, but  students may use them during a five-year period to allow for paid  teaching or research experience.

Nine UCSC students or alumni received graduate research  fellowships: Dale Barr, III, B.A. in psychology, 1993, to attend  Princeton University; Djuna Bewley, current senior in earth  sciences, to attend the University of Colorado, Boulder; Jessica  Britton, B.A. in biochemistry and molecular biology, 1993, now at the  University of Washington; Jonathan Dale, B.A. in marine biology,  1993, now at Boston University; Emily Giambalvo, current graduate  student in earth sciences; Matthew Glickman, B.A. in computer and  information sciences and psychobiology, 1990, now at Carnegie  Mellon University; David Gray, B.A. in biology, 1992, now at the  University of New Mexico; Jeremy Gray, B.A. in psychobiology, 1992,  to attend Stanford University; and Mark Sabbagh, B.A. in psychology,  1993, to attend the University of Oregon.

Three minority students or alumni received minority graduate  fellowships: Michael Atkins, B.A. in chemistry and marine biology,  1993, to attend the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Nora  Espinoza, B.A. in biology, 1992, now at the University of Chicago; and  Ivelisse Rivera, current graduate student in anthropology.
