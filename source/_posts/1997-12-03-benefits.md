title: Update On Domestic Partners Benefits
author: V. Wayne Kennedy  
---

Dear Colleagues:

On November 21, 1997, the Board of Regents authorized President Atkinson to extend health care benefits to adults in a long-term, committed domestic relationship with a UC employee who are either same-sex domestic partners or precluded from marriage under California law because of a family relationship.

We are in the process of formulating and working through the support processes that must be adopted prior to opening enrollment for this benefit. A fact sheet is being prepared to answer questions regarding eligibility and will be issued to the university community early in 1998. We hope to provide a special enrollment later in the spring.

Your patience is requested during this process.

Sincerely,

V. Wayne Kennedy  
Senior Vice President, Business and Finance   
UC Office of the President
