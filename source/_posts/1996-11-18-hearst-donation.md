A $50,000 grant from the William Randolph Hearst Foundation of San Francisco will strengthen public education programs at the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory, a research and education facility operated by UCSC.

The grant will allow educators to augment "Windows to Discovery," the popular program that debuted at Long Marine Lab in 1994. Windows to Discovery serves as a model education program in the ocean sciences, emphasizing the unique environment of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The program promotes public awareness, encourages students to learn about conservation and pursue careers in marine science, and provides K-12 teachers in the region with training and curricular materials.

"The support of the Hearst Foundation will allow us to sustain our current programs and expand several pilot programs into full components of Windows to Discovery," says Dorris Welch, public education director at Long Marine Lab. The grant also builds a firmer foundation for programs envisioned for the lab's planned $4.4 million Visitor Education Center, Welch adds.

Funding from the Hearst Foundation will benefit the following areas:
* Outreach to K-8 students. Long Marine Lab educators will offer a program throughout the academic year that provides hands-on instruction in marine science at regional elementary and middle schools, which often cannot send students on field trips to the lab.
* Interpretive training programs. To strengthen their dedicated group of about 150 volunteer docents, educators will pair experienced docents with trainees in a new mentoring program. Further, twenty student interns from UCSC's degree programs in marine biology and environmental studies will join the annual docent training course, adding fresh perspectives and enthusiasm.
* A multimedia exhibit. The grant will provide permanent equipment for the lab's interactive computer exhibit, "Bay Window," which leads students through the steps of scientific inquiry.
Named for publisher and philanthropist William Randolph Hearst, the Hearst Foundation funds programs in education, health, human services, and culture. It focuses on institutions that provide access and opportunity to underrepresented, low-income, and minority populations.
