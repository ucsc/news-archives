![Melanie DuPuis][2]

**Melanie DuPuis:** Assistant Professor of Sociology

Sociologists of development tend to specialize in foreign countries, but Melanie DuPuis focuses on economic development in the United States. Assistant professor of sociology DuPuis's work on the industrialization of the dairy industry integrates agricultural, industrial, environmental, and consumption studies. Her recent edited volume (with coeditor Peter Vandergeest), _Creating the Countryside,_ examines how government planners re-create rural and wilderness landscapes to meet the needs of new economies. Her forthcoming book, _Milk and Modern Life,_ looks at the emergence of milk as a staple of the American diet. DuPuis earned her B.A. in anthropology from Radcliffe College and her Ph.D. in development sociology from Cornell University. She comes to UCSC from the New York State Department of Economic Development, where she was an environmental policy analyst.

_Melanie DuPuis has written an opinion piece titled "[What Ever Happened to the 'Polluter Pays' Principle?"][3] for Currents online._
