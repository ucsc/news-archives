**Kirsten Silva Gruesz** 

Assistant Professor of Literature  

Kirsten Gruesz's areas of interest are nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature of the Americas, including Latino culture. Her research explores the way that literature was used to unite communities in the early American republics, and particularly in the Spanish-speaking borderlands. She is currently working on a book entitled "Ambassadors of Culture: Poetry and Identity across the Americas, 1823-1898." Gruesz earned her B.A. at Swarthmore College and her doctorate in comparative literature from Yale University. She comes to UCSC from the College of William and Mary.
