**Jonathan Fox,** associate professor of Latin American and Latino studies, has received the Dudley Seers Memorial Prize from the _Journal of Development Studies_ for an article he wrote entitled "Governance and Rural Development in Mexico: State Intervention and Public Accountability." The award, which carries with it a prize of $500, was inaugurated in memory of the late Dudley Seers for the two best articles to appear in Volume 32 of the journal. The award will be presented at the Development Studies Association Conference, which takes place September 11-13 at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, England.

Undergraduate **Michelle Renee,** a senior in environmental studies with a minor in earth sciences, has received a $10,000 scholarship from the Donald A. Strauss Foundation. The scholarship will fund a public service project in which Renee will analyze how the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund has been used--and misused--over the years.
