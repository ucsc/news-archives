title: First Night Santa Cruz Needs Volunteers 
author: Francine Tyler

Swing bands, theater performances, and collaborative art projects are only a few of the entertainment options available at First Night Santa Cruz, a family-oriented New Year's Eve celebration in downtown Santa Cruz.

To make it all happen, First Night organizers need more than 600 volunteers. As one of the event sponsors, UCSC is offering an extra admission button to the first 30 volunteers from the campus community. This button is offered in addition to the flashing admission button First Night gives to volunteers.

The buttons (normally $5 for children ages 6 through 15 and $9 for adults) serve as admission to the night's events. They will be sold starting December 5 at Bay Federal Credit Union offices and Longs Drug Stores throughout the county, and at a number of downtown merchants. Children five and under are admitted free.

The celebration begins at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, December 31, with performances throughout the downtown area. The 45 performance and workshop spaces for the event include UCSC Extension offices in the Galleria Building, which the university has donated once again as a venue.

This year's First Night includes performances by Shakespeare Santa Cruz. The celebration culminates at midnight with a collaborative art project and countdown at the town clock.

To volunteer and claim your additional admission button from UCSC, call Carol Lacey at (408) 459-2559 on or before Monday, December 15. For more information about the event, send e-mail to frstntsc@cruzio.com or call (408) 425-7277.
