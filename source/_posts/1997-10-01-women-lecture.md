SANTA CRUZ, CA--The story of the "Negress Maria," who was on board a  Spanish ship captured by Francis Drake in 1578-79, is one of the stories  that is the focus of a lecture by Margo Hendricks, associate professor of  literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Hendricks's talk, "Portraits in Exile: Englishwomen and Travel in the  Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries," launches the 1997-98 Humanities  Lecture Series, sponsored jointly by UCSC's Humanities Division and the  Museum of Art and History. The talk takes place from 7 to 8 P.M. on Thursday,  October 9, at the Museum of Art and History at the McPherson Center, 705  Front St. The talk is free and open to the public. A reception follows.

According to the accounts of Francis Drake's nephew, John Drake, the  Negress Maria was first the mistress of a Spanish Don and then the sexual  object of Francis Drake (and most likely the other officers aboard Drake's  vessel). "Maria is an interesting figure in the history of the making of the  'New World,'" Hendricks says. "Were it not for John Drake's narrative, little  would be known of this woman. I want to highlight the ways in which  'forgotten' or ignored histories such as that of the Negress Maria are  intricately interwoven with 'literary' representations of women in the New  World," she explains. To do this Hendricks will examine the narrative history  of the Negress Maria with those of two other "Old World" women in the "New  World" as represented in Aphra Behn's novella Oroonoko and Henry Neville's  Isle of the Pines.

Hendricks's research and teaching interests are 16th- and 17th- century literature, women playwrights, cultural studies, theories of race,  and 20th-century British and American drama. She has published on  Shakespeare, Aphra Behn, and Christopher Marlowe and has just completed a  manuscript titled "Forms of Passing: Race in the Making of Aphra Behn." Her  works in progress are "Shakespeare and the U.S. African-American  Community" and "The Philology of Race."
