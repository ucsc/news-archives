Campus arborist **Roger Edberg** is the coauthor of an article titled "Patterns of Structural Failures in Urban Trees: Coast Live Oak _(Quercus agrifolia)_." The article appeared in the January 1999 issue of the _Journal of Arboriculture,_ a publication of the International Society of Arboriculture, which is an organization serving tree-care professionals. An abstract of the article can be found on the journal's Web site. Edberg is currently doing research for a similar article on the blue gum eucalyptus.
