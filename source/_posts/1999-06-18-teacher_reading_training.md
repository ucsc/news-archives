## California Reading/literature Project At Ucsc Offers Teacher Training

What: The California Reading and Literature Project (CRLP) for the UCSC/Monterey Bay region is offering four one-week training institutes for K-3 teachers in the tri-county area this summer. More than 400 teachers will participate in the literacy institutes, which are being offered as part of Gov. Gray Davis's Elementary Reading Initiative.

Why: Gov. Davis has made improving student reading skills a priority of his administration. As part of his Governor's Elementary Initiative, Davis provided $12 million statewide to support teacher development in the area of reading instruction.

Who: The UCSC/Monterey Bay site of the CRLP has offered summer training institutes for the past two years and was poised to expand its efforts this summer with the additional state funds. This year's institutes will focus on new teachers, who will attend in teams of about 10 representatives from schools throughout the region. Approximately 40 schools are registered to attend one of the four institutes. Each school team will be made up mostly of new teachers, as well as administrators and veteran teachers.

The institute will offer teachers proven instructional strategies and assessments that will help them teach reading and evaluate the progress of their students. Faced with new statewide standards in language arts, teachers are looking for ways to help their students reach benchmark goals, said Marlin Adams, regional director of the UCSC CRLP. "Our curriculum content is completely aligned with the new standards. Experienced classroom teachers will demonstrate how they have translated theory and research into practice in their classrooms," she said.

Statewide presenters who bring expertise in the field of literacy will also be offering daily keynote sessions.

When:  
June 21 - 25 UC Santa Cruz (Spanish)  
June 28 - July 2 UC Santa Cruz (English)  
July 5 - 9 CSU, Monterey Bay (English with Spanish breakouts)  
July 26 - 30 CSU, Monterey Bay (English)

Contact: Reporters and photographers who are interested in covering the story are encouraged to call the CRLP Office at (831) 460-3042 or to contact Jennifer McNulty in the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-4399.

Background: The first institute will be conducted in Spanish for teachers who provide primary language instruction in Spanish. The curriculum will also address the challenges faced by teachers in nonbilingual classrooms who are teaching English reading to English language learners. The institute will be followed by 80 hours of additional training during the school year. The cost for sending a team of 10 is $1,000 per school. Teachers who complete the 120-hour course and submit student assessment data as part of a statewide CRLP research project will receive university credit and a $1,000 stipend.
