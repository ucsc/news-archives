## UC Santa Cruz Applications Continue To Show Steady Increase

SANTA CRUZ, CA--For the third consecutive year, an increasing number of prospective students have applied for admission to the University of California, Santa Cruz, reflecting growing interest in the campus on the part of college-going students and their families.

A total of 17,542 prospective students applied for fall 1999, an increase of 11.3 percent over applications received at the same time last year. Universitywide, applications were up 8.1 percent.

"We're continuing to see strong interest in the excellent academic programs of the campus, as well as interest in our college system, which provides a living and learning environment that offers social and academic support," said J. Michael Thompson, UCSC associate vice chancellor for outreach, admissions, and student academic services.

This is the second fall application cycle in which UC has operated without affirmative action policies. Thompson noted that UCSC increased the enrollment of underrepresented minorities on campus last fall and is on track to do so again in fall 1999. Freshmen applications from African American students are up 13.3 percent; applications from Asian Americans, which are underrepresented at UCSC, are up 28.5 percent; applications from Latinos are up 13.1 percent, while applications from Chicanos are up 7.7 percent and Filipino Americans are up 11.6 percent. Applications from American Indians declined 4.5 percent.

"We're seeing increased applications from almost all groups for next fall," said Thompson, adding that the quality of students applying for admission to UCSC is also increasing. "At UCSC, increases in quality and diversity are complementary, not contrary."

The campus saw a 10.2 percent increase in applications from students at California community colleges, which reflects UCSC's desire to meet the enrollment targets set last year by the UC president and the chancellor of the state community college system. In a memo of understanding, they hoped to increase by 33 percent the number of community college students transferring to UC campuses by the year 2005.

The campus's ongoing effort to make prospective students aware of the opportunities available to them at UCSC is a joint endeavor that involves the cooperation of faculty, staff, and, in particular, current students who are willing to share their experiences with high school seniors, noted Thompson. One of the most successful outreach programs administered by the Office of Admissions is "Taking UCSC Home," in which current UCSC students visit their old high schools to encourage students to consider attending UCSC. In its third year, the program now includes participants who credit the university's "ambassadors" with helping them decide to enroll at UCSC, said Thompson.

Despite growing interest in the campus, UCSC remains committed to managing its growth to comply with long-range development plans, said Thompson, noting that UCSC will be selective about the students it chooses to enroll.

The next step in the admissions cycle is to notify students of admission, which will take place March 1. On April 17, the campus holds its annual open house, Banana Slug Spring Fair, which draws several thousand prospective students and their parents to campus. The deadline for students to notify the university of their plans to attend in the fall is May 1.
