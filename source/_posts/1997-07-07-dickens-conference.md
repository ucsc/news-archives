title: Dickens Universe, Scholarly Conference Return This Summer
author: Barbara McKenna
---

The Dickens  Project presents its 17th annual summer conference,  the Dickens Universe, from August 3 to 9. The conference features  seminars and lectures by distinguished Dickens scholars, films,  videos, a book fair, daily workshops for teachers,  Victorian teas, a full-scale Victorian dance, and other  surprises. The program is designed for both teachers and the  general public. The only prerequisite is a fondness for reading  Dickens and talking about his books.

This year's conference will focus on Dickens's own favorite  fictional "child," David Copperfield (in the book by the  same title), as well the favorite Jane Austen novel, _Pride and  Prejudice._ The nonresident registration fee for the  conference is $175.

Overlapping the Dickens Universe, from August 7 to 10, the  Dickens Project will present a scholarly conference on  "Reversions: Twentieth-Century Appropriations of  Nineteenth-Century Culture," to which all Dickens Universe participants  are invited without additional fee. Well-known scholars of  19th-century literature and culture will discuss the  ways that the late 20th century seems to  have "rediscovered" 19th-century culture, and the ways that  rediscovery has led to appropriations, adaptations, and  inheritances of the cultural capital of the Regency, Romantic, and  Victorian periods.

Conference registration for non-Universe  participants is $60 and includes lunch.
