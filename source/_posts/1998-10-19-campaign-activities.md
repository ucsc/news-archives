title: Statement on Campaign Activities on the UCSC Campus
author: UCSC Currents
---

In conformity with university policies and regulations, the following statement is intended to assist those who are involved with campaign activities--candidates, campaign workers, and registered campus organizations.  

Specific policies and regulations on the use of university properties and resources are included in the _Rule Book: Policies and Regulations Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students.  
_

Questions about the use of university properties and resources may be referred to the Student Organization Advising and Resources Office (SOAR), the Office of Student Affairs, and the college offices. Staff in these offices also can provide guidance and assistance with proposed events and activities.  

The university affirms the spirit of free inquiry and open debate on the campus. Time, place, and manner limitations on such activities are intended to allow the university to carry out its normal functions without undue disruption, to allow all members of the campus community to conduct their private and professional lives in a manner consistent with their rights and responsibilities as citizens and members of the university community, to maintain the neutrality of the university as a state instrumentality on political matters, and to provide reasonable protection to persons against practices that would make them involuntary audiences or invade their privacy.   

Equitable and fair enforcement of the policies and regulations which serve as the basis for these guidelines are primarily dependent on the good faith and cooperation of individuals and groups involved in campaign activities. Complaints should be referred to Student Affairs.  

1. The following properties are designated areas for public expression. They are open to the public generally (7:00 a.m.-8:00 p.m.), but may also be reserved by campus groups.  
    * the Upper Quarry Amphitheater at any time when it has not been reserved  
    * college "quadrangles," subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the College Administrative Officer after consultation with the college student government  
    * the steps, outside patio, service roadway, and small "green" on the north side of McHenry Library  
    * the large "green" south of Natural Sciences 2 and east of the Thimann Lecture Hall  
    * the unpaved area between the "Fiat Lux" sign and the Granary and Stone House buildings near the intersection of High Street and Coolidge Drive 
    * the patio and specific areas adjacent to the Student Center in accordance with policies developed by the governing board.
These areas of the campus are open to the public generally and may be used for campaign activities, subject to reasonable regulation of time, place, and manner. For example, no prior permission is needed to hand out literature or to meet students, faculty, and staff as they pass through such areas; there are limitations on the use of amplified sound, the setting up of tables, and the posting of banners and signs; and there may be limitations on gatherings at particular times and places where such activities would interfere with normal university functions, including traffic and pedestrian safety. Recreation areas and parking lots are_ not_ open to the public.

Note: registered student organizations may reserve space for tabling activities in the bookstore parking lot area by contacting the Bay Tree Bookstore (459-4544).

2. Outdoor, public-access bulletin boards and kiosks may be used for posting (maximum poster size is 17" x 22" or equivalent area) by members of the campus community and the general public. All posted materials must clearly indicate the name of the person(s), group(s), university unit(s), or campus organization(s) responsible for posting them and the day by which they are to be removed. Literature _cannot_ be placed on automobiles in campus parking lots. No signs or banners may be posted in other areas of the campus without express permission. Requests for exception to the policy to post banners or signs (which are considered "outdoor displays") should be addressed to College Administrative Officers (for college areas), the SOAR Director (for the Student Center area), the Student ID Office (2nd floor Redwood Bldg.) for the Whole Earth Restaurant deck, or Student Affairs (for all other areas).
3. Residential facilities (including residence halls, apartments, the Camper Park, Koshland Way, Hagar Court, and Cardiff Terrace units, college houses, and University House) are the homes of the residents, and access is generally limited to residents, their invited guests, and university personnel to maintain safe living environments. (Residents of residential halls are permitted to distribute campaign literature to other residents of the same building.)
4. During established meal times, dining facilities are reserved for their intended primary purpose. Solicitations, including campaigning, are not permitted within the controlled-access dining rooms in Cowell, Stevenson, Crown, Merrill, College Eight/Oakes, and Porter colleges. Certain campaign activity may be conducted in restaurants and coffee shops, subject to rules to be adopted by the management of each facility designed to assure that the time, place, and manner of the permitted activities are compatible with the primary function of the facilities.
5. Campaign literature may be mailed to campus addresses through the U.S. Postal Service. Campaign literature may not be sent through the campus mail or stuffed in the mailboxes of students, faculty, or staff, or distributed door-to-door in residential or office facilities (except as noted in 3. above). Note: The priority in which mail is processed on campus is based on the class that it is sent, e.g., first-class mail is processed within 24-hours of receipt; third-class (bulk rate mail) addressed to individuals can take up to three days to be processed.

The Campus Resource Directory may not be used for political purposes. Lists, rosters, or databases with faculty, staff, or student names and addresses are_ not _provided as public information, except as they are already available via the online campus directory service provided by CATS and the Office of the Registrar.

6. Registered students may form an organization to support (or oppose) a ballot measure or candidate for public office and register with the SOAR office in the Student Center (459-2934). Registered campus student organizations may use university facilities, sponsor meetings and events, and sponsor presentations by candidates and spokespersons. (Note: If any mandatory student fees are used to fund a specific political/religious/ideological activity sponsored by a registered campus student organization or student government, registered students who object to the use of their fees for these purposes may apply for a proportionate individual refund by contacting SOAR or the college student government for a refund application.

Candidates and spokespersons may, upon invitation, participate in meetings and forums sponsored by registered student organizations and university units. Such organizations may be permitted to use a room in a nonresidential university building. Otherwise, the interiors of such buildings are reserved exclusively for their university purposes and are not available for campaign activities.
