Marine biologist **Mary Silver** and her work on marine snow were the focus of an in-depth article in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel._ Silver, who will be leading one of a series of workshops for teachers offered this spring by Long Marine Lab, has been studying the tiny bits of downward drifting ocean materials for more than 20 years.

The news of an award received by artist and psychologist **Pavel Machotka** from his homeland caught the attention of area media. Both KSCO-Radio and the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ featured stories on Machotka, who will, in April, receive the degree of Doctor of Education _honoris causa,_ from the 650-year-old Charles University of Prague in the Czech Republic.

Political scientist **Gwendolyn Mink** was featured on KUSP-Radio's _Talk of the Bay_ show. Mink was interviewed by host Eric Schoeck to discuss her new book, _The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History._

Citing the poor performance of U.S. high school students in international math and science tests, natural sciences dean and chemist **David Kliger** made a case for improving the quality of K-12 science and math education in an opinion piece in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel._ Acknowledging the difficulty of reaching students raised on TV, Kliger argued that scientific process and accuracy should not and need not be sacrificed for the sake of making science entertaining.

**Alan Ritch,** head of Collection Planning at McHenry Library, was interviewed by the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ for an article on the pros and cons of the electonic library. Ritch moderated a discussion on the issues facing today's librarians after a showing of Terry Sanders's video _Into the Future: On the Preservation of Knowledge in the Electronic Age_ at the Santa Cruz Public Library.
