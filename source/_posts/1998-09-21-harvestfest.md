## Fifth Annual Harvest Festival At UCSC October 10

SANTA CRUZ, CA--This year's UC Santa Cruz Harvest Festival will be packed with more music, fun, and activities for children than ever before. The festivities will take place on Saturday, October 10, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the UCSC Farm.

Local favorites the Banana Slug String Band will delight the crowd with its unique blend of original music and environmental education. The Banana Slugs' performance will begin at 2 p.m. Other highlights include crafts for the kids, workshops, more live music, tasty food, and tours of the UCSC Farm.

Activities for children will include hayrides, potato printing, face and pumpkin painting, and cornhusk doll making. Gardeners can soak up tips from the experts at talks on topics including seeds, chickens in the garden, and medicinal plants. Among the tasty culinary delights will be fresh-pressed apple juice, roasted corn, gourmet sandwiches, snacks, and baked goods. Community groups will set up informational displays, fresh organic produce will be available for purchase, and merchandise from the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden will also be on sale. Also this year, a new children's garden site will be dedicated at the Life Lab Science Program adjacent to the Farm. (See detailed schedule information below.)
