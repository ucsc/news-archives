Several of the University of California's top administrators have issued statements in the wake of the passage of Proposition 209 on November 5.  

In a  [ letter][2] to the UCSC campus community last Wednesday (November 6), Chancellor Greenwood pledged that the proposition's passage would not reduce UCSC's commitment to the "principals of nondiscrimination and inclusion."  

In a separate [letter][3] to the university community, UC President Richard C. Atkinson outlined the steps his administration would take to "fulfill our responsibilities as a public university in the nation's most ethnically and culturally diverse state."   

The Office of the President compiled fact sheets on the effects the passage of Proposition 209 will have on the University of California. It also distributed a letter to campus chancellors from Provost C. Judson  King, providing guidance on implementing the changes required by Proposition 209, and a statement by Tirso del Junco, chair of UC's Board of Regents.
