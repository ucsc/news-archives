**A work crew from the California Youth Authority** will clear a campus fire road on Monday, August 18. The crew of 15 people will cut brush back from either side of the road, which starts behind the UCSC Fire Station and runs behind the campus to the Twin Gates area off Empire Grade. The work on the road will help it act as a natural fire break and clear the way for emergency vehicles.

**Sailboats, computer equipment, generators, and vehicles** are among the items expected to be sold in October at a public auction on campus. The auction is scheduled for Saturday, October 4, in front of the H-Barn, next to Parking Services. Viewing of the items will start at 9 a.m.; bidding begins an hour later.

To make the auction successful, Surplus Operations requests that university departments send to surplus any items in working condition they no longer need. Departments should list items to be sold on a surplus request form and forward the form to Surplus Operations no later than Friday, September 5. For more information, call Steve Goldie.
