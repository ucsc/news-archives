** Jiayuan Fang:** Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering

![][2]

Jiayuan Fang conducts research on high-speed electronic circuits. His interests include applied electromagnetics, numerical simulation methods, and electromagnetic modeling and simulation of electronic packaging. Fang is working on ways to avoid the interference that results from coupling or "cross-talk" between different signals in integrated circuits and on circuit boards. Problems with electromagnetic interference are becoming more serious as microprocessor speeds increase. Fang received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from UC Berkeley in 1989. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he was an associate professor of electrical engineering at the State University of New York at Binghamton.
