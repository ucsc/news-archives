title: UC Santa Cruz Physicist To Discuss Chaos Theory

SANTA CRUZ, CA--From earthquakes to roiling thunderstorms, the  patterns of nature often seem random. However, these events follow  the same simple physical laws that govern the gentle arc of a  pendulum's swing or the sweeping orbits of planets. Michael  Nauenberg, professor emeritus of physics at UC Santa Cruz, will  discuss the reasons behind this orderly disorder in a free public  lecture titled "Chaos and the Arrow of Time," on Tuesday, February  27\. Aimed at a general audience, his talk will begin at 7:30 p.m. in  Classroom Unit 2 on the UCSC campus.

Chaos theorists study the unpredictable. Unlike the cycle of  tides or the ricochet of billiard balls, chaotic phenomena cannot be  predicted far into the future. Weather forecasters and economists  have a good idea of what might happen in the short run, but long- term guesses are notoriously unreliable. That's because chaotic  systems are hypersensitive to initial conditions. Tiny fluctuations,  such as a mild breeze or the actions of a lone stockbroker, can  quickly spin out of control.

Nauenberg will use the fitful kicks and twists of a double- jointed pendulum to demonstrate chaotic behavior. He will also  discuss how the steady drips of a leaky faucet become chaotic, a  phenomenon first investigated in the 1970s at UCSC.

Nauenberg is spending a year in the Netherlands, pursing  research on chaotic physics and the history of seventeenth-century  physics and mathematics. He holds the visiting van der Waals chair  in theoretical physics at the University of Amsterdam and is also a  visiting professor at the University of Leiden.

The Division of Natural Sciences at UCSC is sponsoring  Nauenberg's lecture. For more information, call the UCSC Public  Information Office at (408) 459-2495.
