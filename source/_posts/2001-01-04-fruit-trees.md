SANTA CRUZ, CA--'Tis the season to be thinking about fruit trees--buying, planting, and pruning. No matter what questions you have, there's an upcoming workshop that will provide all the answers.

* General care and varietal selections for the home garden will be the topic on Saturday, January 20. Orin Martin, manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden at UC Santa Cruz, will offer this "Fruit Tree Q&A," a two-hour free public workshop at San Lorenzo Garden Center, 235 River Street, in Santa Cruz. The workshop takes place from 10 a.m. to noon.
* Pruning of pome fruit trees (apples and pears will be the subject on Saturday, January 27, at the Louise Cain Gatehouse at the UCSC Farm. Proper pruning improves the health, appearance, and productivity of fruit trees, and Martin will show you how to get the most out of your pome fruit trees. Wear warm clothes; heavy rain cancels. The time is 10 a.m. to noon. The fee is $5 for members of the Friends of the Farm & Garden; $10 for nonmembers.
* Pruning of stone fruit trees (peaches and plums) will be covered during the final workshop on Saturday, February 3, from 10 a.m. to noon at the Louise Cain Gatehouse at the UCSC Farm. Martin will shift the focus to stone fruit trees, offering tips on maximizing your crop. The fee is $5 for members of the Friends of the Farm & Garden; $10 for nonmembers.

The Louise Cain Gatehouse is located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available across the street from the Blacksmith Shop in the Physical Plant parking lot.

Public workshops are sponsored by the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden, a community-based group that promotes public awareness of organic gardening and farming. The Friends also support CASFS' Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture by providing scholarship and program assistance.
