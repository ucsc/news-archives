**Donald Osterbrock,** professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics and astronomer emeritus, UC Observatories/Lick Observatory, received an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison at commencement exercises on May 16. Osterbrock was on the University of Wisconsin faculty from 1958 to 1973, when he came to UCSC as director of Lick Observatory. The university cited him for his influential research on luminous gases in our Milky Way galaxy, as well as for his books on major observatories and the lives of famous American astronomers. Osterbrock also holds honorary degrees from Ohio State University and the University of Chicago.

**David Wellman,** professor of community studies, received a $20,000 fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies to write a book on the topic "The Color of Politics: Race, Class, and Culture in the Formation of Union Identity." Using 208 oral histories Wellman conducted with rank-and-file founders of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union throughout the West Coast and Hawaii, he will construct an account of how the ILWU formed a union identity that crossed racial, ethnic, and gender boundaries.
