SANTA CRUZ, CA--Six faculty members from the University of  California, Santa Cruz, will be featured in a downtown lecture  series presented jointly by the Humanities Division at UCSC and the  Art Museum of Santa Cruz County at the McPherson Center for Art  and History. The series will offer a range of lively topics of interest  to the general public--from the state of politics in Eastern Europe,  to great moments in opera, to snow vocabulary in Eskimo languages.

The talks are free and open to the public and take place the  second Wednesday of each month at the McPherson Center, 705 Front  St., Santa Cruz. Talks run from 7 to 8 p.m. with a reception following  each presentation. A schedule follows. For more information, call  the Humanities Division at (408) 459-2696 or the Art Museum at  (408) 429-1964.

January 10: "Great Moments in American Opera," presented by  professor of American studies John Dizikes.

What makes for a memorable night at the opera? Dizikes will  look at three notable episodes in American operatic history to  answer that question. One story is of remarkable vocal achievement,  another depicts an event of historical and political significance, and  one is a tale of personal tragedy. Dizikes's talk will include slides  and opera music.

Dizikes is the author of Opera in America: A Cultural History  (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993), a richly detailed and  engaging account of opera's performers, conductors, composers,  audiences, and impresarios, and memorable performances from 1735  to present. The book received a 1993 National Book Critics Circle  award and the 1993 gold medal for nonfiction from the  Commonwealth Club of California.  February 14: "Never Too Late: Re-weaving the Threads of a  Filmmaker's Improbable Career," presented by professor of  literature Julianne Burton-Carvajal.

When she died last May at the age of 73, Maria Luisa Bemberg  was considered the most important Latin American filmmaker of her  generation. However, the famed Argentinean's career was a brief  one, confined to the later part of her life. It wasn't until the age of  60 that Bemberg broke into the film industry--overcoming her  society's prejudices against women and her family's traditional  views. Bemberg went on to produce such acclaimed works as Camila  (1984), Miss Mary (1986), I, the Worst of All (1990), and I Don't  Want to Talk About It (1992). In her talk, Burton-Carvajal will  discuss Bemberg's life and career, which is detailed in her book-in- progress, "Three Lives in Film." Burton-Carvajal is chair of the Latin American and Latino  Studies Program and founding director of the CineMedia Project,  both at UCSC. She is author of Cinema and Social Change in Latin  America: Conversations with Filmmakers (Austin: University of  Texas Press, 1986) and Social Documentary in Latin America  (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1990).

March 13: "Language, World View, and Reality," presented by  linguistics professor Geoffrey Pullum.

Does the language we speak influence our view of the world?  Frequently, when that question comes up, so does the oft-cited (but  ill-founded) example of the Eskimo languages, reputed to have a vast  vocabulary of words for snow. In his talk, subtitled "How many  words do Eskimos really have for snow, and what implications could  that possibly have?," Pullum will survey the history of the legend of  Eskimo snow vocabulary, consider what the psychological  implications would be if Eskimos really did use 50 (or 19 or 103)  words for snow, and take a brief look at the actual facts.

Pullum is the author of a dozen books, including The Great  Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,  1991), which, he explains, "contains discussions of the crazed  linguistics of libel laws, the folly of the "English Only" enthusiasts,  and an imagined conversation between Noam Chomsky and  Commander Spock."

April 10: "Why Do Communists Win Elections in Eastern Europe?,"  presented by history professor Peter Kenez.

In Lithuania, Hungary, and Slovakia, former communists are  stepping into top-ranking government posts, and in Russia, the  faction enjoying the highest approval rating is the Communist Party.  Kenez will explore the forces at play across Eastern Europe that are  bringing into power representatives of the party that was once so  reviled.

Kenez, who was born in Hungary, has studied the history of  Russia and the former  Soviet Union. His books include The Birth of the Propaganda State:  Soviet Methods of Mass Mobilization, 1917-1929 (Cambridge; New  York: Cambridge University Press, 1985); Cinema and Soviet Society,  1917-1953 (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press,  1992); and the autobiography Varieties of Fear: Growing Up Jewish  Under Nazism and Communism (Washington, D.C.: American University  Press, 1995).

May 8: "Abundant Righteousness: Moralism in Contemporary Political  Life," presented by professor of women's studies and legal studies  Wendy Brown.

We live in a polarized society, poorly trained in the art of  compromise and acceptance. One need only look at campaign  literature from recent elections to see the proof. Brown has tracked  the history of the polarization, which she sees as a migration in  both personal and public politics away from constructive dialogue  toward extremist moralizing. Such behavior isn't confined to the  right wing, Brown notes, citing the left-wing agenda of political  correctness as an example. Another example she offers is the  current debate around hate speech--both those defending freedom of  speech and those anxious to control hateful expressions tend to  gravitate towards the most extreme positions.

Brown is the author of States of Injury: Power and Freedom in  Late Modernity (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995). She  serves as codirector of UCSC's Center for Cultural Studies and is  chair of the advisory board to the UC Humanities Research Institute  in Irvine.

June 12: "Is Chivalry Dead?: Love Poetry in the Modern Age,"  presented by assistant professor of literature Peter Gizzi.

Peter Gizzi will read twentieth-century poems of love, from  Ezra Pound's translations from ancient China and Rome to Bernadette  Mayer's contemporary sonnets of urban New York.

Gizzi's poetry has been published in chapbooks and in his first  book, Periplum, or, I the Blaze. He is editor of the 1995 Exact Change  Yearbook and former editor and publisher of o*blek--an  internationally acclaimed poetry magazine. He is currently editing  the papers of the late San Francisco Bay Area poet Jack Spicer and  completing his second collection of poems, "A Textbook of Chivalry."
