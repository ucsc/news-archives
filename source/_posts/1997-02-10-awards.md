**Lori Kletzer,** assistant professor of economics, has received a prestigious grant from the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. The two-year grant for nearly $39,000 will support Kletzer's work on a book about the effect of increasing foreign competition on U.S. manufacturing and employment.

Kletzer's book will examine the relationship between changes in international trade, job displacement, and employment in U.S. manufacturing. She is studying the link between international trade and domestic jobs by looking at net employment change and gross employment flows, which includes new hires, recalls, quits, displacements, temporary layoffs, and retirements. Kletzer hopes to complete the manuscript, titled "Trade, Job Loss, and Employment," by August 1998.
