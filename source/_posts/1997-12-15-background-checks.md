title: Current Employees Subject To New Policy On Background Checks

A new policy regarding background checks of prospective university employees also applies to current UCSC employees who are transferred, promoted, or reclassified into critical positions.

Background investigations may include a check of an individual's criminal history, credit history, and/or verification of a license, certificate, or degree required for employment.

The policy, which took effect November 1 following a lengthy review process, is designed to bolster the hiring process by ensuring that individuals hired into staff and student positions meet the job qualifications and to protect the university's interests.

In addition to applying to prospective staff and student employees and volunteers in critical positions, the policy also applies to existing UCSC employees who might seek new jobs or who are transferred or reclassified into new jobs that meet the criteria for critical positions.

Such criteria, as designated by universitywide guidelines, include individuals with, for example, access to master keys; direct responsibility for the care, safety, and security of humans; and direct access to or responsibility for cash or controlled substances. The campus has a list of current positions, as designated by the assistant chancellor for human resources, that fit the criteria and would require background investigations.

"We want to let current employees know that the policy is now in effect, so that if they're transferred, promoted, or reclassified into a critical position, they'll be covered," said Labor Relations Manager Linda Listmann, chair of the policy-development task force. "We've been implementing background checks on a limited basis--for cashiers, anyone who handles petty cash, and child care workers, for example--but this new policy formalizes our campus procedures and expands coverage."
