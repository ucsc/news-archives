title: Task Force Requests Input On Campus Smoking Policy
author: UCSC Currents
---

Over the course of this academic year, UCSC has used several methods to improve compliance with the campus smoking policy. At the recommendation of the Smoking Task Force, the campus has posted more than 300 "No Smoking" signs, distributed information about the policy, and created a mechanism to enforce the rules.

The Smoking Task Force will reconvene next month to evaluate the effectiveness of this year's efforts to enforce the policy. They will use input from the campus community as part of the evaluation process.

Any student or member of the faculty or staff who would like to participate should consider the following questions:
* From your perspective, have the efforts of the past year to decrease second-hand smoke from entering buildings made a difference?
* Do you have any suggestions for reducing the amount of second-hand smoke entering buildings, and/or for increasing compliance with the campus smoking policy?

Send your replies and other comments to ADA Compliance Officer Susan Willats, c/o Business and Administrative Services. Comments are due by Friday, May 22.
