**UCSC Researchers Find All Students Benefit From Strong Cognitive And Academic Instruction Conducted In Their First Language**

How should we educate English language learners for success academically and to become productive and integrated members of American society? State, federal, and local policies should be congruent with research-based findings, in order to stimulate and, when necessary, regulate programs to be most effective.

Summarized below are the findings from research conducted by CREDE and other bilingual/ESL researchers on the effects of bilingual education, the goals of which are to teach competence in English language, English literacy, and English-based academic skills. This research shows that:

There is a critical shortage of teachers who can work successfully with English language learners, whether they be in mainstream or bilingual/ESL classrooms. Research is under way to document effective methods for recruitment, training, and support of such a workforce.

Further information can be obtained from CREDE, the Center for Research on Education, Diversity & Excellence, a national research-and-development center funded by the U.S. Department of Education. CREDE's research goal is to identify and examine the most-effective forms of education for students at-risk of educational failure due to linguistic and cultural diversity, poverty, or geographical isolation. CREDE's offices are located at UCSC, and Roland G. Tharp is the director.
