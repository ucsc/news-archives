author: UCSC Public Information Office

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Among the major environmental laws that could  come before the new Congress for renewal or revision are the  Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Superfund  toxic-waste cleanup legislation. At the University of California,  Santa Cruz, experts in these and other environmental subjects are  available for media interviews. UCSC boasts one of the leading  undergraduate programs in environmental studies in the country and  this fall became the first campus in the UC system to offer a  doctoral program in environmental studies. The program focuses on  agroecology, conservation biology, and political economy, with an  emphasis on pragmatic problem solving.

The following faculty experts are available to share their  knowledge and insights with reporters and to comment on recent  news developments. Reporters may contact professors directly at  the telephone numbers or e-mail addresses listed below or may call  the UCSC Public Information Office at (408) 459-2495 for  assistance.

Michael Soule--Endangered species; biodiversity; Wildlands Project (408) 459-4837 soule@cats.ucsc.edu

The founder and first president of the Society for Conservation  Biology, Soule is a nationally recognized expert on biodiversity and  the plight of endangered species. He has helped mobilize support  from the scientific community for the reauthorization of the  Endangered Species Act. His interests include population viability,  extinction of amphibians, and analysis of policy conflicts; his  research has pioneered the application of genetics to the  conservation of biological diversity. A founding member of the  Wildlands Project, Soule is at the forefront of the ambitious--and  controversial--proposal to protect biodiversity in North America by  establishing a network of wilderness reserves, human buffer zones,  and wildlife corridors that would cover hundreds of millions of  acres.

Stephen Gliessman--Sustainable agriculture; farming; rain-forest  policy  (408) 459-4051 gliess@zzyx.ucsc.edu

A leader in the field of sustainable agriculture, Gliessman  specializes in the conversion of conventional farming practices to  ecologically based alternative growing methods. He is available to  discuss these methods and his ongoing work with farmers who are  developing alternatives to chemical fertilizers and pesticides.  Gliessman's expertise also carries over to rain forests; he was a  member of the National Research Council committee that produced a  recent report on sustainable agriculture in the humid tropics. The  report identified the critical need for the development of  sustainable agricultural practices to replace more damaging forms  of farming in the tropics--such as large-scale monocrop export  agriculture--that degrade land that has already been cleared and  drive farmers looking for new land further into the forests.

Daniel Press--Old-growth forests; toxics management; Superfund  legislation (408) 459-3263 dpress@cats.ucsc.edu

An environmental policy analyst, Press focuses on the management  of complex environmental problems such as the debate over old- growth forests and the handling of toxics in California. He is  knowledgeable about the interaction of local community activists,  government agencies, and national environmental organizations on  issues of environmental public policy, specifically regarding ancient  forests and toxic-waste management. Sites of his timber work  include the Shasta-Trinity Forest, Mendocino County, and Humboldt  County in California, as well as the Opal Creek area north of the  Willamette National Forest in Oregon; his fieldwork on toxics has  taken place in Silicon Valley and Kettleman City, California. His  recent investigation of the paper industry concluded that making  recycled paper is far cleaner for the environment than producing  paper from virgin-wood fiber.

Margaret FitzSimmons--Resource management; water policy;  farming; trade policy (408) 459-3525 fitzsim@cats.ucsc.edu

FitzSimmons focuses on resource management and the tensions that  are played out between regional economic and environmental  interests in arenas that include conservation and ecotourism,  agriculture, and forestry. She is coauthor of Thirst for Growth:  Accountability and Innovation in Public Water Agencies, which  traces the behind-the-scenes manner in which urban southern  California has jockeyed to get water from competing users.  FitzSimmons's current work focuses on the future of farming in the  United States, particularly in light of the environmental and  economic implications of the North American Free Trade Agreement  and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

David Goodman--Agro-food systems; social impacts of  biotechnology; trade policy (408) 459-4561 hatters@cats.ucsc.edu

Goodman studies world food systems with an emphasis on the social  and environmental consequences of interactions between capitalist  economies and the developing world. His policy-oriented work  focuses on the role of technological innovation in modern food  production, and he monitors the social and policy impacts of  biotechnology. For example, the development of high-fructose corn  syrups has affected the exports of sugar-producing countries such  as Brazil and the Philippines. He is also available to discuss the  agricultural aspects of trade treaties, such as NAFTA and GATT.

Steven Minta--Wildlife ecology; endangered species; GIS; land-use  management (408) 459-2568 minta@cats.ucsc.edu

Trained in wildlife ecology, Minta focuses on conservation issues  that include endangered-species management and the development of  new methods to measure human impacts on ecological systems,  particularly terrestrial landscapes. As a consultant for  governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations, Minta  consults in population monitoring, spatial analysis, and geographic  information systems (GIS) technology, which he applies to the  problems of land use and species management; he directs UCSC's new  Training and Research Facility for Geographic Information Systems.  Among the species Minta has studied are bison, badger, coyote,  bobcat, black-footed ferret, grizzly bear, wolf, bison, deer, ground  squirrels, deer mice, and goshawks. He has worked in Montana and  Wyoming, and is currently working in the Yellowstone National Park  area and in California.
