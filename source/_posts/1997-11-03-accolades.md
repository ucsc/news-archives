**Greg Rau,** senior researcher at the Institute of Marine Sciences, was one of 270 scientists elevated to the rank of fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Rau was nominated by the Section on Biological Sciences for his expertise on the cycling of carbon in the environment, most notably in marine plankton and oceanic sediments. Fellows are selected each year for their outstanding contributions toward scientific or social advancement. The University of California accounted for 34 of this year's fellows, more than 12 percent of the national total.

Rau is based off campus at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where he conducts much of his work. He currently is applying his research approaches to a study of carbon in Martian meteorite ALH84001, suspected of harboring fossils of ancient microscopic life.

Latin American and Latino studies chair **Manuel Pastor** was the keynote speaker at a recent strategy session on the Monterey County economy held by the Monterey County Economic Strategy Forum. Discussion topics included transportation, quality of life, and maximizing technology.

**Abraham Seiden,** professor of physics and director of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics, is chairing the university subpanel of the Department of Energy's High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP), a body charged with periodic studies of scientific opportunities and priorities in the U.S. high-energy physics research program. Seiden's subpanel will help to recommend a scenario for the next decade of research in the field, with a focus on the contributions of university research teams. The group will consider the field's evolution toward fewer, more complex particle detectors, the trend toward large international efforts, and broad improvements in computer and communications technology.
