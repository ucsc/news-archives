title: New Attendant-Assisted Parking Expands Capacity Of East Remote

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The East Remote parking lot will have room for  200 additional cars starting next month, under a temporary  attendant-assisted parking program sponsored by Transportation and  Parking Services (TAPS).

The drivers of these 200 cars will be allowed to park in the  aisles of the paved lot but will be required to leave their keys with  an attendant. Attendants will move the cars if needed to let other  vehicles out of the lot.

When the program takes effect--tentatively scheduled for  Monday, November 3--the East Remote lot will hold up to 1,200  vehicles and will be configured in the following way:
* 430 spaces in the center of the lot will be unaffected by the  program.
* 570 spaces will be open for drivers to park without leaving  their keys. Drivers parking in these spaces, however, may have to  wait while an attendant moves a vehicle that has blocked their exit  from the lot.
* 200 spaces will be provided in the aisles, and drivers  parking in these spaces will be required to leave their keys.

Growing enrollments over the last two years have put  increasing pressure on the East Remote lot, said Jule Tanner, TAPS  acting director. An unpaved area south of East Remote that has been  traditionally used as an overflow area during the first two weeks of  school remained open after the two-week deadline this year because  the number of cars drastically exceeded available spaces, Tanner  said. More than 150 cars have parked there each day this year.

Once the attendant parking program starts, TAPS plans to  close the dirt area and hopes to keep it that way. "We're hoping that  we can find a solution that will afford us not to become dependent  on the dirt area as an overflow option," said Tanner.

In last two years, TAPS has sent overflow parking to the Barn  Theater, which only accommodates 90 cars. When that lot fills, cars  have been diverted to college lots or other lots on campus in what's  been a frustrating and time-consuming process.

A task force has been assembled to look at resolving parking  problems at East Remote and throughout the entire campus, Tanner  added.

Solutions might include expanding remote parking and  encouraging and expanding the use of alternatives to cars, said TAPS  senior analyst Kira Stoll. Another TAPS goal is to see that the  campus core becomes more accessible to pedestrians and bicyclists.

The attendant-assisted program is scheduled to operate until  April 1998, but may be extended past that time if there still a need  to accomodate overflow cars, Tanner said. The program will be  closed during during winter and spring breaks. Parking permits will  continue to be required.

TAPS currently has no plans to institute attendant-assisted  programs in smaller campus lots or in central campus, Stoll said.  Attendant parking is considered to be most efficient on larger, flat  lots like East Remote.

As currently planned, attendants will be present at the lot  from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday. The days and hours  may change if needed to better serve people who use the lot. TAPS'  assessment of the East Remote lot indicates that it does not fill up  before 10 a.m.

To reclaim their key, drivers must show a parking "claim  check" to the attendant. Drivers returning after the attendant kiosk  is closed must reclaim their key from the TAPS Transit Office at the  base of campus, or use a spare key to move their car and reclaim  their key the following day.

TAPS has contracted with AMPCO System Parking to provide  the attendant-parking services. AMPCO provides similar parking  services for Berkeley, Davis, and UCLA, said Stoll.
