**Conference Features Presentations By World's Leading Scholars As Well As Public Performances**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Leading scholars in Andean Quechuan studies from  around the world will convene at the University of California, Santa  Cruz, September 4-6 for the conference, The Quechua Expressive Art:  Creativity, Analysis, and Performance. The conference features  lectures, symposia, and performances. All events take place in the  campus's Music Center, Room 131, and are free and open to the  public.

The Quechua (pronounced ket-shwa), who inhabit the Andean  regions of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and northwest  Argentina, are the largest Native American culture in the Western  Hemisphere, with an estimated population of between 10 and 13  million people. The UCSC conference will look at historical and  contemporary Quechua musical and verbal artistic forms in song,  dance, poetry, narrative, folktale, myth, and riddle from both  scholarly and performance perspectives.

Performances, panel sessions, and round-table discussions  feature 25 eminent scholars from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador,  Germany, the Netherlands, Peru, Switzerland, the United Kingdom,  and the U.S. These experts will offer scholarly and performance- oriented presentations on Quechua folkloristics, ethnomusicology  and musical performance, anthropology, linguistics, literature,  ethnohistory, and cultural studies.

Conference organizers are John Schechter, UCSC associate  professor of music, and Guillermo Delgado, UCSC lecturer in Latin  American and Latino studies. Delgado is a member of The Indigenous  Research Center of the Americas, a universitywide program studying  indigenous issues from transnational perspectives. Schechter is  founder and director of UCSC's Latin American Ensembles. Now in  their 11th year, the performance groups focus on Quechua- and  Spanish-language traditional musics of South America. Both  scholars have published widely on Quechua cultural expressions, in  the areas of exegesis, translation, ethnomusicology, cultural and  linguistic anthropology, historical linguistics, and cultural studies.

Quechua Expressive Art is supported by the UC Humanities  Research Institute, the UCSC Divisions of Arts and Social Sciences,  the Music Department, and the Chicano/Latino Research Center. A  complete conference schedule is attached. For more information,  call (408) 459-2019 or 459-3449.
