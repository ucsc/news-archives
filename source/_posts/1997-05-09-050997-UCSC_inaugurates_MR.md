SANTA CRUZ, CA--Dr. M.R.C. (pronounced "Marci") Greenwood will be  inaugurated as the seventh chancellor of the University of California, Santa  Cruz, on Friday, May 23. The public is invited to attend the ceremony, which  will begin at 12:30 P.M. in the Upper Quarry Amphitheater.

Leon Panetta, former White House chief of staff for President Clinton  and U.S. representative for the Central Coast, will be the keynote speaker at  the inauguration. Panetta will address the question: "Will We Have the  Leadership to Face the Challenges of the 21st Century?"

Greenwood will be inaugurated in a traditional academic ceremony.  Among the dignitaries who will participate in the ceremony are UC President  Richard C. Atkinson, who will inaugurate the chancellor; Tirso del Junco,  chair of the UC Board of Regents; UCSC alumna Kathryn D. Sullivan, the first  American woman to walk in space; and Santa Cruz Mayor Cynthia Mathews.

The ceremony will begin with a processional of faculty and staff  members and representatives from UCSC's sister institutions wearing full  academic regalia. Eli A. Silver, chair of UCSC's Academic Senate, will lead  the processional into the amphitheater. The program is expected to be about  two hours in length and will be followed by a public reception at the Cowell  College Provost's House.

Greenwood, who began her tenure as chancellor last July, was selected  following a nationwide search by an advisory committee of Regents, faculty,  students, staff, and representatives of the UCSC Alumni Association and UC  Santa Cruz Foundation. Acting on President Atkinson's recommendation, the  Regents named Greenwood chancellor in April 1996.

Greenwood came to UCSC from UC Davis, where she had been dean of  graduate studies and vice provost for academic outreach. During her time at  UC Davis, Greenwood took a leave and served for nearly two years in the  Clinton White House as associate director for science in the Office of  Science and Technology Policy.

The chancellor, who worked with Panetta when both were in the White  House, said the former congressman's participation in her inauguration is a  "great personal honor for me and a privilege for UC Santa Cruz. I know Mr.  Panetta is dedicated to the Monterey Bay Area, and I am certain his remarks  will greatly enhance the ceremony."

From 1977 to 1993, Panetta was a U.S. Representative from  California's 16th (now 17th) congressional district. He served eight full  terms and had begun serving his ninth when in January 1993 he was  confirmed by the U.S. Senate as director of the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) in the Clinton administration. Panetta directed OMB until July  1994, when he was named White House chief of staff, a position he held  through the end of President Clinton's first four-year term this past  January.

Music planned for the event includes two pieces composed for the  inauguration: Fanfare, composed in 1997 by UCSC student Michael Kripakov,  and Fanfare for Extraordinary Women, composed in 1997 by UCSC Professor  David E. Jones. The chancellor's son, James Greenwood, will perform the  Benediction. The program will be sign-language-interpreted.

Other inaugural participants include Duncan A. Mellichamp and Sandra  J. Weiss, chair and vice chair, respectively, of the UC Assembly and  Academic Council; Michael Caulfield, chair of UCSC's Student Union  Assembly; Kathleen Flint, president of UCSC's Graduate Student Association;  Ricky Bluthenthal, president of the UCSC Alumni Association; Stoddard P.  Johnston, president of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation; Richard Vasquez, chair  of the UCSC Staff Advisory Board; Henry T. Yang, chancellor of UC Santa  Barbara; Barry Munitz, chancellor of the California State University system;  John D. Hurd, president of Cabrillo College; and Ron Gonzales of Hewlett- Packard, a UCSC alumnus and former Santa Clara County supervisor.

Metro buses and campus shuttles will provide service to and from the  Bay Tree Bookstore parking lot--located near the amphitheater--before,  during, and following the inauguration. The bookstore parking lot will be  closed the day of the inauguration, although parking spaces will be available  in the lot for disabled attendees.
