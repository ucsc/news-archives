The **men's water polo team** finished the year ranked 23rd in the nation, and junior **Sam Radetsky** was named to the Division III All-American Squad, Second Team. The team's success is particularly remarkable in that men's water polo at UCSC was only resurrected this year after being dropped to club status in the early 1990s, and UCSC provides no financial support for the team.

Senior **Emily Tryon,** a forward and tri-captain for the Slugs women's basketball team, was chosen Athlete of the Week last week by the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ sports staff for scoring a personal-best 28 points and pulling down 9 rebounds in the Slugs' game against Holy Names College on January 17. Tryon has been averaging a team-high 17.6 points.
