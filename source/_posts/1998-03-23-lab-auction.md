SANTA CRUZ, CA--Long Marine Lab's Whale of an Auction, the largest  annual fund-raising event for public education programs at UC Santa  Cruz's marine laboratory, will take place on Friday, April 3.

This year's auction, the 13th annual, begins at 6 P.M. in the  Porter College Dining Hall at UCSC. Hundreds of people attend the  auction each year, which raises tens of thousands of dollars for the  lab's efforts to inform schoolchildren and the general public about our  unique place on the Central Coast.

The evening will include a dinner buffet by Michael's Catering;  champagne, caviar, and a smoked-salmon tasting provided by the  docents of the Long Marine Lab; music by the Paris String Quartet; and- -of course--both silent and live auctions.

Items up for bid this year include trips to Hawaii and Mexico,  fine art, jewelry, wines, romantic getaways, surfboards, and kayaks.  Explorations of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary by land,  boat, or private plane with science professors and exclusive  demonstrations of Monterey Bay research will also be up for bid during  the auction.

The auction funds public education programs at Long Marine Lab,  one of the few marine research facilities open to the public. The lab  hosts over 30,000 visitors a year and provides special classes for  students of all ages and teachers.

Through March 27, tickets are available for $30 by calling (408)  459-2883. Some tickets will be also available at the door for $35. The  auction is hosted by the lab's docents, the Friends of Long Marine Lab  Board of Directors, and lab staff.
