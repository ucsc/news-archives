SANTA CRUZ, CA--Remote islands of surreal beauty, the foggy,  windswept Aleutians are thousands of miles from heavily populated  areas. Even so, the islands harbor a nasty reminder of human  activity: Sea otters and bald eagle eggs from the western Aleutians  carry potentially harmful levels of DDT and other contaminants.

A team led by scientists from the University of California,  Santa Cruz, found that sea otters from the western Aleutians  contained almost twice as much of the industrial compound PCB as  otters from the central California coast, an area known to have  agricultural and industrial contamination. The otters also carried  almost 40 times more PCBs than otters from a relatively  uncontaminated site in southeast Alaska.

Such high PCB levels may have an insidious effect on the  otters' health. Similarly high levels can cause reproductive failure  in mink, a closely related species.

Bald eagle eggs contained elevated levels of both DDT and PCB.  DDT, known to thin the eggshells of birds of prey elsewhere, may  harm these raptors as well: Eagles on the island with the highest  levels of DDT are reproducing at half the rate of those on other  islands.

Although the researchers can't pinpoint the sources of the  pollutants, their distribution patterns yield some clues. The PCBs  may come from former military activity on some of the islands; the  DDT could be windborne or waterborne contamination from  agricultural use in Asia.

"We expected the Aleutians would be very clean because it's a  remote oceanic environment--that's why we picked it," said James  Estes, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and UC  Santa Cruz. "We found these high levels in the Aleutian Islands,  higher even than in California, so that was a big surprise. The levels  of compounds in these animals are alarmingly high."

Estes and several colleagues published their work in the  current issue (July 25, 1997) of Marine Pollution Bulletin. Coauthors  are researchers Corinne Bacon and Walter Jarman of UCSC's Institute  of Marine Sciences; Ross Norstrom of the Canadian Wildlife Service;  and Robert Anthony and Keith Miles of the U.S. Geological Survey at  Oregon State University and UC Davis, respectively.

Sea otter populations are still recovering from intensive  hunting in the 1700s and 1800s. Most otter populations in Alaska and  the Aleutians are now growing at almost 20 percent per year, a  healthy rate. In contrast, the California population is increasing at  just 5 percent per year and is still listed under the Endangered  Species Act as threatened.

To investigate whether contaminants such as DDT and PCB are  impeding the recovery of sea otter populations off California's  Central Coast, the researchers compared contaminant levels in the  livers of California sea otters to otters from sites believed to be  clean. To test for pollutants, the team collected carcasses from  beaches in central California and on the Aleutian island of Adak in  1991 and 1992. Alaskan Natives provided otter carcasses from  southeast Alaska.

Surprisingly, California's otters did not carry the highest  amount of PCBs. That dubious honor went to the otters from Adak.  Their livers harbored 309 parts per billion total PCBs, while  California otters had 185 parts per billion, and those from southeast  Alaska had only eight.

Because they found no dead otters on the other Aleutian  Islands, the scientists also collected bald eagle eggs that had failed  to hatch. That analysis confirmed the PCB contamination in the  western Aleutians, particularly on the islands of Adak, Amchitka,  and Kiska. DDT also contaminated the eagle eggs, and it exhibited a  striking trend: The further west the island, the more DDT.

These patterns provide clues to the pollutants' origins. The  PCBs may come from military operations: Eggs from the three  islands with former military activity had four times more PCBs than  eggs from Tanaga, the only island that has not been a military site.  Since eggs from the more westerly islands have higher DDT levels,  that subtance may come from Asia via wind and water currents. "Anytime you see DDT, it's a recent application, within the last  few months or years," Jarman said. "One theory is that if they use a  ton of it in China, we'll see it in the Aleutians." DDT also may come  to the Aleutians via migratory animals, especially birds, Estes  noted.

Other studies also hint at trouble for the region's marine birds  and mammals. Said Estes: "That whole North Pacific ecosystem is a  worry because lots of things are declining--the Stellar sea lion, for  instance. It raised the issue in our minds that maybe contaminants  were playing some role."

After the team completed its study, Estes discovered that  otter populations on Adak are not faring as well as previously. With  funding from the Department of the Navy, the team is starting a  more detailed investigation of contamination levels in otters from  the western Aleutians to southeast Alaska. Jarman said, "I expect  there'll be hot spots and clean spots."
