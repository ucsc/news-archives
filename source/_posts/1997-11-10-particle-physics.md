SANTA CRUZ, CA--In the rarefied world of high-energy physics,  researchers at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP)  at UC Santa Cruz have earned reputations as premier makers of tools  to detect the smallest bits of matter. Now, their work on some of  the most innovative physics experiments of the next decade has  earned a major boost, in the form of a $208,661 grant to purchase  critical pieces of equipment.

The grant consists of $156,361 from the National Science  Foundation and $52,300 in matching funds from UCSC's Natural  Sciences Division. With an additional $15,000 from SCIPP, the funds  will pay for two devices: a probe station, which tests the silicon  chips used in SCIPP's particle detectors, and an ultrasonic wire  bonder, which forges bonds between the chips and intricate banks of  microelectronics. Computers will run both devices, dramatically  increasing quality control and the speed of research over the manual  versions of these machines used at SCIPP for many years.

Huge detectors will incorporate SCIPP's chips as arrays of  silicon "strips" that register the fleeting passages of charged  particles. These arrays, which track particles with unparalleled  accuracy, were developed mainly by SCIPP researchers.

"We have by far the most knowledgeable university-based  effort on this technology," said SCIPP director Abraham Seiden,  professor of physics at UCSC. "Silicon-strip detectors and their  associated electronics have become our specialty."

Indeed, the U.S. Department of Energy commissioned SCIPP in  1990 to oversee construction of the innermost portion of a detector  for the Superconducting Super Collider, using silicon strips. After  Congress killed that project, Seiden and his colleagues were able to  apply the same technology as collaborators on other planned  experiments.

The new equipment, scheduled to arrive at UCSC in December,  will contribute immediately to the following projects:
* An astrophysics satellite called GLAST, for Gamma-ray  Large Area Space Telescope. A joint project of NASA and the  Department of Energy, GLAST will detect gamma rays, which  emanate from the cores of active galaxies and other violent objects.  The satellite will convert gamma rays into charged particles and  then track them precisely through numerous layers of finely etched  silicon. It is due for launch by 2005.
* SCIPP researchers, led by associate professor of physics  Robert Johnson, are adapting their silicon-strip techniques for the  demanding environment of space. "We are developing extremely low- power and low-noise electronic amplifiers for the silicon strips,"  said adjunct professor of physics Hartmut Sadrozinski. "Power is a  very important consideration, because we won't have an extension  cord running up into orbit."
* ATLAS, a detector planned for the Large Hadron Collider in  Geneva, Switzerland, also scheduled to begin taking data in 2005.  This gigantic collider will accelerate particles to the highest  energies yet achieved. This will allow physicists to explore the  internal structures of subatomic particles and, they hope, the very  origins of mass. As was the case with the Superconducting Super  Collider, SCIPP is contributing to an international team that will  design and build the innermost silicon tracking device for ATLAS.  SCIPP research physicist Alex Grillo directs the overall silicon- strip electronics effort.

The sheer number of chips and connections in these  sophisticated experiments makes it clear why SCIPP technicians  need the automated equipment. Both GLAST and ATLAS will include  millions of separate silicon channels. Researchers must probe each  channel for reliable function and bond it to its accompanying  electronics via five wires, each finer than a human hair. The  projects are about 100 times larger than any SCIPP has attempted to  date, Seiden said.

SCIPP scientists also will use the new equipment on at least  two other projects. One is a detector for the planned "B Factory" at  the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. This machine should reveal  why matter became dominant over antimatter in the earliest  moments of the universe. A second project, directed by SCIPP  physicist Alan Litke, will use arrays of electrodes as "retinal  readout systems" to better understand how the retina processes and  encodes visual images.

National Science Foundation funding for the new devices was  awarded through its Major Research Instrumentation Program.  Seiden noted that SCIPP received one of just three high-energy  physics grants in NSF's 1997 instrumentation program.
