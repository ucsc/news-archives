SANTA CRUZ, CA--Many of the world's leading biochemists and  molecular biologists will convene at UC Santa Cruz this week for the  first international symposium devoted to the physical blueprints of  one of life's most basic and crucial molecules.

The meeting, titled "RNA Structure," runs from Thursday  through Saturday, June 26-28, at UCSC's Earth and Marine Sciences  Building. About 250 scientists are expected to attend. Scientific  talks are open only to registered participants.

Speakers will describe their latest research on the varied  forms of RNA, or ribonucleic acid. Less known than its sister  molecule DNA but far more versatile, RNA may have played the key  role in the origins of the first cells able to reproduce themselves. In  modern organisms, RNA directs the assembly of new proteins by  ferrying genetic information from DNA and translating our genetic  codes--processes essential to life.

Biomedical researchers also strive to understand the workings  of RNA viruses, such as HIV, and RNA's function in antibiotic  resistance and other medical mysteries.

"This is a tremendously ripe time in the field of RNA  structure," said Harry Noller, Robert L. Sinsheimer Professor of  Molecular Biology and director of UCSC's Center for the Molecular  Biology of RNA. "More new structures will be coming out in the next  year than everything that's been done to date."

Learning the structure of RNA--or any biomolecule, for that  matter--is vital to understanding its function, Noller noted. RNA can  twist into a dizzying array of shapes in the cell, much like twisted  telephone cords. "Active sites," where RNA interacts with other  molecules, dot the surfaces of these shapes. Each precise shape  dictates a specific role for the molecule, much as a key will open  only one lock.

The field is so hot, Noller stated, that virtually every RNA  pioneer is coming to Santa Cruz this week. Attendees will include  Nobel laureate Thomas Cech of the University of Colorado, Boulder,  and four members of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences: Peter  Moore and Thomas Steitz of Yale University, Norman Pace of UC  Berkeley, and Noller himself.

Other invited speakers will hail from Canada, Denmark,  England, France, Germany, Scotland, Sweden, and across the U.S.

Sessions at the meeting will concern how cells manufacture  proteins; RNA structures as determined by nuclear magnetic  resonance, crystallography, and computer models; interactions  between RNA and proteins; and the structures and behaviors of  "ribozymes," bits of RNA that catalyze reactions.

Sponsors are the Center for the Molecular Biology of RNA,  funded in 1992 by a $2.5 million grant from the Lucille P. Markey  Charitable Trust, and the RNA Society.
