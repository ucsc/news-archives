If you feel inclined this time of year to help those in need, here are some opportunities for giving. Local agencies need contributions of cash, toys, and other assistance, as well as volunteers to help serve meals, distribute gifts, and pitch in with other events. To help those farther from home, agencies that are sending hurricane aid to Central America are listed, too.

The **Volunteer Center's **"Adopt a Family" program matches families in need with donors, providing toys, clothing, and a food certificate for families in Santa Cruz and Watsonville. If your unit would like to adopt a family for the holidays, call the Santa Cruz Volunteer Center, Carol Hitchcock at 427-5077, or the Watsonville Volunteer Center, Anna Amorim at 722-6708.

The **Second Harvest Food Bank's **annual Holiday Food Drive continues through the week of December 16th. Food bins have been placed throughout campus, and contributions will be distributed to pantries for holiday boxes.

The **California Grey Bears** need volunteers to help with their annual holiday dinner at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium on Sunday, December 6 (6 a.m. to 3 p.m.) and with meals delivered to people who are homebound. Call Lynn Francis, 479-1055.

**Familia Center** provides food boxes and holiday gifts to needy residents of Santa Cruz County. The center could use donations of new toys, food, or cash. Contact Ana Espinoza at 423-5747 for more information.

**Families in Transition** works with homeless families to help them gain permanent housing and employment and achieve self-sufficiency. For the holidays, they could use food, new toys, gift certificates, or cash. To donate, call Bonnie Harrington at 458-7124.

Volunteers are needed for **First Night Santa Cruz**. UCSC is an official sponsor of this annual New Year's Eve event, which has added many more venues this year. All volunteers receive a complimentary button that entitles them to attend performances in indoor venues, and the first 30 UCSC volunteers who call Teri Pelton at 459-5190 will receive an additional button. The First Night volunteer office is located at 104 Walnut Street, Suite 204, in Santa Cruz. For more information, call Serena Dionysis at 425-7277.

The **Central American nations of Honduras and Nicaragua** will be recovering from the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch for years. If you'd like to help by making a cash contribution, here are some agencies that are sending aid:
* **American Red Cross**, International Response Fund, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, D.C. 20013, (800) HELP-NOW, Spanish (800) 257-7575.
