title: Bottom Layer Of Earth's Mantle May Be Partially Molten, According To Seismic Evidence

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A peculiar type of seismic wave has unveiled a  major surprise deep within the earth: The base of the planet's  mantle, long assumed hard as a rock, instead may be partially  molten.

Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz,  studied seismic waves that skim along the sharp boundary between  the earth's outer core and lower mantle. Under the south-central  Pacific Ocean, something bogs down the speed of the waves by about  10 percent--a huge amount by geophysical standards. The most  likely cause, the researchers claim, is that melted material bathes  the mantle rock and transforms it into a thick mush.

If true, this conclusion violates the geophysical canon, which  holds that the earth consists of four distinct layers: crust, solid  rocky mantle, outer core of liquid iron, and inner core of solid iron.  The upper mantle melts in regions where hot material rises to the  planet's surface, but no one suspected the lower mantle--even in the  cauldron of the inner earth--might behave the same way.

"This layer could fundamentally change our understanding of  the mechanics of the core-mantle boundary," says mineral physicist  Quentin Williams, lead author of the study and associate professor  of earth sciences at UC Santa Cruz. "Suddenly, the bottom of the  mantle might not be as stable as we thought. It's a provocative  result."

Williams and seismologist Edward Garnero, a postdoctoral  researcher at UCSC, published their results in the September 13  issue of the journal Science.

The seismic evidence points to a partially molten layer  between 5 and 40 kilometers thick in the zone under the South  Pacific. Williams and Garnero believe the layer probably encircles  the globe, but it may be as thin as a few kilometers or even a few  hundred meters in most areas. That's a tiny fraction of the 2,900- kilometer-thick mantle. But because the suspected layer touches the  dynamic outer core, the consequences would be dramatic.

For instance, says Williams, the layer may help heat flow from  the core into the mantle, a process that ultimately drives the  relentless march of earth's crustal plates. Indeed, other  seismologists recently found a broad swath of unusually warm  mantle under the South Pacific. That swath lies directly above the  layer identified in the new study, a correlation that Williams calls  "extremely exciting."

Further, a partially molten layer would conduct electricity  more readily than solid rock. That would influence the planet's  magnetic field, the workings of which are still a mystery.

The Santa Cruz researchers acknowledge that other  geophysicists may not readily accept their interpretation of the  slow seismic waves. Rather than partially melted rock, some  scientists will favor chemical reactions between the outer core and  the lower mantle. Iron from the liquid outer core may interact with  silicates and other minerals at the bottom of the mantle to form  alloys--essentially, "rusting" on a planetary scale. This change in  the property of the rocks could affect the way seismic waves travel  through them.

Williams and Garnero do not rule out this possibility in their  paper. However, they view it as far less likely than a small fraction  of melt. "Reactions must occur between the core and the mantle,"  Williams says. "Any time silicates and iron get together, they mess  each other up. But it simply wouldn't depress the seismic velocities  to the extent that we see."

Gauging the sluggishness of the seismic waves was an arduous  task for Garnero and several colleagues, notably seismologist Donald  Helmberger of Caltech. They examined records of about two dozen  large earthquakes in the southwest Pacific as measured by seismic  stations in North America. The seismic energy they pinpointed was a  "diffractive" wave, so named because it ripples for some distance  along the mantle side of the core-mantle boundary. Some waves got  delayed by slogging through the slow layer; those delays showed up  as extra bumps in the seismograms.

Enter Williams, who studies the properties of inner-earth  minerals under high pressures and temperatures. His calculations  showed that to account for the seismic slowdown, between 5 and 30  percent of material within the layer must be molten. At about 5  percent, the melt would spread evenly among the rock grains to  create slippery, hot conditions, much as a thin sheen of oil greases a  container of ball bearings. If the fraction is higher, the melted  material might occupy molten pockets within otherwise solid rock,  like a hellish Swiss cheese.

Garnero says the conditions at the core-mantle boundary  beneath the south-central Pacific are not unique; researchers  believe the temperature there is the same worldwide. "We would  hypothesize that if this partial melt occurs anywhere, it would  occur everywhere," he says. "But if it's thinner than a few  kilometers in other parts of the globe, we don't have the resolution  with our seismic techniques to detect it."

Both researchers note that their theory is testable, via both  mineral-physics experiments in the lab and further seismic studies.  Garnero and seismologist John Vidale of UCLA are now exploring  another phase of seismic wave that would slow down even further-- as much as 30 percent--in a partially melted layer.
