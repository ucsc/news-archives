_Science News_ printed a series of illustrations from a supercomputer simulation by astrophysicist **Lars Hernquist** and Joshua Barnes, a collaborator from the University of Hawaii. The pictures, showing two spiral galaxies colliding and merging to create a bloblike elliptical galaxy, accompanied an article on the early stages of galaxy formation in the universe.

**Elliot Aronson's** work in social psychology was the subject of a full-page article in the _Chronicle of Higher Education._ The story focused on Aronson's recent research on AIDS prevention, which uses people's desire not to be thought hypocritical to encourage them to use condoms.

Physicist **Joel Primack's **views on the religious resonances of certain theories in cosmology led off an article in the _New York Times._ The article described a recent international meeting of cosmologists and astrophysicists at the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences in Berkeley. Speakers explored the compatibility of religion with modern theories of the universe's birth.

The acting and directing of theater arts' **Danny Scheie** caught the eye of a reviewer from the _San Francisco Chronicle,_ who found what he saw "very, very funny." Scheie codirected and starred in _The Mystery of Irma Vep,_ which played at the Berkeley City Club and is currently showing at the Magic Theatre.

The media turned out in force to cover the first week of summer school at Frank Paul Elementary in Salinas. The unique bilingual session uses **Life Lab's** garden curriculum to teach science to K-6 students. Coverage included KION-TV, KSBW-TV, KSMS-TV, and the _Salinas Californian_ and _Monterey Herald._ The summer school is part of a collaboration among UCSC's Education Department, seven school districts, and Life Lab.

**Linda Rosewood Hooper,** now with CATS and formerly with the Dickens Project, was featured in an episode of the Learning Channel's _Festival of Great Books_ series. The hourlong segment, which focused on Charles Dickens's _Great Expectations,_ used clips from interviews with a range of people for the segment--from Hooper to Dickens scholars (some affiliates of the Dickens Project), actor Ethan Hawke, and author John Irving. The Dickens Project also provided background information and materials for the segment.

Those irresistible kids from Aromas School who have written a bilingual book about the university attracted reporters from the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ and the _Watsonville Register-Pajaronian_ when they were honored by **Chancellor Greenwood** at a recent reception at University House.

**Manuel Pastor's** work on urban economic development policies was the subject of a lengthy article in _La Opinion,_ the Spanish-language daily in Los Angeles.
