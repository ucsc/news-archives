SANTA CRUZ--Sixth graders in Walt Schmidt's science class at Los Arboles  Middle School in Marina troop outside each class period to measure the  temperature and precipitation and observe the clouds. Using their  classroom's computers, they send the information to the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration (NASA) via the Internet, where each day's weather  record is maintained as part of an international project.

"NASA is using the information we give them to better understand  weather satellite images," Schmidt says. Of more interest to the teacher, his  students are getting hands-on exposure to real science.

The computer connection at Los Arboles is one of the results of an  innovative partnership between the University of California, Santa Cruz, and  the Santa Cruz and Monterey County Offices of Education. The partnership is  part of a wider collaboration known as the Monterey Bay Regional  Educational Futures Consortium (MBReEF).

As part of the partnership, UCSC's Communications and Technology  Services (CATS) is supporting and advising the two offices as they develop  and maintain a regional K-12 computer network.

When the network is completed in 1998, it will link 220 schools and  the district offices in the two counties and provide access to the Internet via  California State University's network; by the end of last month, 74 schools  were connected.

The network allows students, teachers, and administrators to tap into  the rich resources of the information superhighway, allowing them to send  and receive electronic mail and enter the World Wide Web.

Connecting a single computer to the Internet is a simple task.  Efficiently and correctly linking  \--over-- computers in two counties to each other and a single network service  provider is far more complicated.

"We view this as academic technology transfer," says UCSC's Fred Siff,  associate vice chancellor for CATS. "We learned how to set up a network by  doing it for our own students. It only makes sense that we would share that  knowledge with the K-12 schools that surround us."

Since 1993, CATS has helped with this task by lending its staff's  technical expertise. Staff have recommended hardware and software,  designed the network architecture, negotiated licensing agreements and  Internet-connection services, and helped troubleshoot problems.

"We've really been helping to install the plumbing," says UCSC network  engineer Jim Warner, who has helped with the network as a CATS employee  and volunteer since its inception.

In May, UCSC made its partnership official with the county offices of  education and helped the offices pay for costs related to its services through  a $40,000 contract. The university paid half of the contract with  discretionary funds from the Chancellor's Office, and each county office  chipped in $10,000. The contract covers UCSC's consulting and Network  Operations Center (NOC) services for the period of May 1995 to December  1996.

"I think it's a great gesture on the university's part to reach out to the  K-12 community and keep its network moving along," says Mike Mellon,  director of instructional resources and technology for the Monterey County  Office of Education. "The contract helps us get our institution thinking about  how to come up with resources to support the network over the long term."

UCSC and the two county offices of education are part of the Monterey  Bay Regional Educational Futures Consortium, a group of local educational  institutions that came together in late 1993 to develop the  telecommunications infrastructure for schools, libraries, and research  institutions in the Monterey Bay Area.

Their effort reached a milestone last November when 36 K-12 schools  in Monterey and Santa Cruz counties went on-line as part of a project funded  by a grant from the Pacific Bell California Regional Research and Education  Network (CalREN). By the end of last month, a total of 39 schools in Monterey  County and 30 in Santa Cruz County were wired with a high-speed digital  line that is capable of linking hundreds of computers at each school to the  regional network.

Teachers are beginning to use the network in their classrooms in a  variety of ways. "The content on the network has gone beyond what I  thought could happen," says Rowland Baker, administrator of media science  and technology at the Santa Cruz County Office of Education. "We've got on- line science magazines and virtual field trips all over the county. It's a very  exciting time."

Some of the ways schools are using the network are:

* Fourth and fifth graders at Happy Valley School in Santa Cruz will ride a  virtual covered wagon down the Oregon Trail as part of a national program  sponsored by America Online. Every week, teacher and technology specialist Kirsten Commons will pull historical and  geographic information  off the Internet about the latest stop on the trail. Taking characters based on  historical figures, the kids in her class will learn geography and history as  they decide each week whether to rest, take another trail, or press on, she  said. Commons's students will also study earthquakes, current events, and  geography as they use the Internet to track earthquakes around the world.
* Other students are learning about the stock market through an  Internet-based stock market simulation developed by teacher Jory Post. Post  has also developed (TOWS) The On-Line Write Stuff, a nationwide on-line  writing magazine for fourth- through sixth-grade students. A local edition is  printed and distributed countywide. Kirsten Commons may be reached at  (408) 429-1456.
* Third- and fourth-grade students at Alianza School in Watsonville will  participate in a "culture box" project with students at a Guam elementary  school. The Watsonville and Guam students will each collect items that  represent local cultures and talk to one another via e-mail, says teacher Fred  Mindlin. Later, the two groups will exchange their collections using  traditional mail. Last year, Mindlin's class wrote, illustrated, and published  on the World Wide Web a science story they wrote in concert with 25 other  schools in the U.S. and Canada. Mindlin can be reached at (408) 728-6333.
* A group of students at Monterey High School and its related school,  Monterey Academy of Oceanographic Science, work in the library after school  on the high school's home page. Approximately 40 students set up the page  last year, says librarian Marilyn Canady. This year, the group will meet to  improve the page and keep it current. Also, students in economics and civics  classes will tap into stock market and election information on the World  Wide Web as part of their course curriculum. Canady can be reached at (408)  649-1074.
* Fourth and fifth graders at Seaside's George C. Marshall Elementary School  have used the library's fifteen computers to research reports on whales,  volcanoes, and other subjects on the Web. Librarian Jane Snibbe says the  Web has provided a wealth of information that wasn't accessible before. She  can be reached at (408) 899-5467.
* Students at Los Arboles Middle School in Marina are creating virtual field  trips as participants in the CalREN project. A team of six children developed a  multimedia presentation on jellyfish in the Monterey Bay canyon with  footage from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. They plan to  post their field trips on the Web, says library media specialist Don  Livermore. He can be reached at (408) 384-7833.
* This year for the first time, Main Street School in Soledad will have access  to e-mail and a computer server that will allow them to post students' Web  pages on the WWW. Bob Gwinn, the technology mentor for the school, says  teachers attended a summer class on using the Internet and are eager to  include it in their curriculum. Gwinn may be reached at (408) 678-3923.
