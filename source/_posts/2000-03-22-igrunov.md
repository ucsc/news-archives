## Leading Russian Political Strategist To Discuss Election Results April 5

SANTA CRUZ, CA--One of Russia's leading political strategists will discuss the outcome of Russia's presidential election during a free public talk on Wednesday, April 5, from 7 to 9 p.m., in the Baobab Lounge at Merrill College on the UC Santa Cruz campus.

Vyacheslav Igrunov, the chief organizer for Russia's leading democratic party, Yabloko, and the director of Grigorii Yavlinsky's current presidential campaign, will discuss "Russia's Presidential Elections: The Yeltsin Succession and What Comes Next." His visit is being sponsored by UCSC's Politics and History Departments.

"Igrunov will discuss how this election figures into the drama of Russian politics and what we can expect in its wake," said Michael Urban, professor of politics and chair of the Politics Department.

The Russian presidential election is taking place March 26.

Igrunov, who has been a member of Russia's parliament since 1993, is the founder of an archive for the democratic movement in Russia that Urban calls "the best single source of information on democracy in Russia." He is also director of the Institute for Humanities and Political Studies in Moscow, a highly regarded private social science research institution that was the first nongovernmental research institution organized in Russia since the 1917 revolution.

With a long history of political dissidence behind him, Igrunov has emerged as one of Russia's most effective political organizers. His visit to UCSC will be preceded by talks at UC Berkeley and Stanford University.
