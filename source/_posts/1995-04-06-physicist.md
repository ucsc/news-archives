SANTA CRUZ, CA--Physicist Onuttom Narayan, who will join the UC  Santa Cruz faculty in July, is one of 100 outstanding young  scientists and economists who have won prestigious fellowships  from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the foundation announced last  week. The fellowship is worth $30,000 per year for two years.

Narayan, age 30, currently is a junior fellow at Harvard  University. He accepted a faculty position at UCSC last year, but he  deferred his appointment until July 1995 to complete his work at  Harvard. Narayan holds an M.S. in physics from the Indian Institute of  Technology in Kanpur, India, and an M.A. and Ph.D. in physics from  Princeton University. He will be an assistant professor of physics at  UCSC.

Narayan studies disordered systems that are unstable for long  periods. The presence of "dirt," or impurities, in such systems makes  them behave in different and more complex ways than uniform  systems. Using mathematical analysis, Narayan strives to  understand those behaviors. Applications include high-temperature  superconductors, which hold promise for carrying electricity  cheaply and efficiently, and the extraction of oil from porous rocks.

Since 1955, the Sloan Foundation has awarded nearly $69  million to more than 3,000 young researchers. Seventeen former  Sloan Fellows have received Nobel Prizes. The average age of the  1995 fellows is about 32 years. They were selected from among  hundreds of scientists in the early stages of their careers, based on  their exceptional promise to contribute to the advancement of  knowledge. Candidates are nominated by department chairs and other  senior scholars familiar with their talents.

Sloan Fellows are free to pursue whatever lines of inquiry are  of most interest to them, and they are permitted to use fellowship  funds in a wide variety of ways to further their research aims. This  flexibility often is of great value to young scientists who are at a  pivotal stage in establishing their own independent research  projects.
