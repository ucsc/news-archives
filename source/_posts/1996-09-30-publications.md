**Susanne Jonas,** lecturer in Latin American and Latino studies, is the author of an article titled "Dangerous Liaisons: The U.S. in Guatemala," which appeared in the June 2 issue of the journal _Foreign Policy._ In the article, Jonas reviews the U.S.'s involvement in the longest and deadliest civil war in Central America. She argues that the U.S. should use its unique influence with the Guatemalan army to press for demilitarization of Guatemala, and that unless civilian control of the military is established, the peace process and democratization cannot move forward.  

**Larry Millsap,** head of Bibliographic Records, and former UCSC librarian Terry Ellen Ferl are the authors of "The Knuckle-Cracker's Dilemma: A Transaction Log Study of OPAC Subject Searching," which appeared in the June 1996 issue of _Information Technology and Libraries._
