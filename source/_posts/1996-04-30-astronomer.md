SANTA CRUZ, CA--Astronomer Jerry E. Nelson of the University of  California Observatories/Lick Observatory, UC Santa Cruz, was one  of 60 leading scientists and engineers elected today (April 30) as  new members of the National Academy of Sciences.

Election to the academy, one of the highest honors for  American scientists, recognizes distinguished and continuing  achievement in original research. Among this year's honorees were  nine University of California professors: four from San Diego and one  each from Berkeley, Irvine, UCLA, San Francisco, and Santa Cruz. The  academy's membership of 1,760 now includes twelve faculty  members (eight of them emeritus) at UCSC.

A professor of astronomy and astrophysics, Nelson has gained  renown as principal designer and project scientist for the world's  largest optical telescopes: the W. M. Keck Telescope in Hawaii and  its twin, Keck II, which astronomers will dedicate on May 8. Each  telescope has a honeycombed array of 36 mirror segments, aligned  precisely by computers to act as a single reflective surface ten  meters wide. This design concept, which seemed radical when Nelson  first proposed and advocated it in the mid-1970s, has led to  dramatic advances in astronomy since Keck I began taking scientific  observations three years ago.

"I feel honored and privileged to be elected to the academy,"  says Nelson. "My election is a tribute to all of those people who,  from very early on, worked long and hard on developing ideas for the  Keck Telescope--especially the engineers who have brought it to  fruition and the superb astronomers at UC and Caltech who have done  such exciting science with it."

Nelson is now working on refining the quality of images from  both telescopes, developing an "adaptive optics" system for Keck II  to counteract the blurring effects of the planet's atmosphere, and-- ultimately--combining some images from Keck I and II to create  ultrasharp resolution.

Nelson, age 52, came to UCSC in 1994 after many years at UC Berkeley. He received his B.S. in physics from the California  Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. in elementary particle physics  from UC Berkeley. He has earned several honors for his work on the  Keck Telescopes, including the 1995 Dannie Heineman Prize for  Astrophysics from the American Astronomical Society and the 1996  Joseph Fraunhofer Award from the Optical Society of America.
