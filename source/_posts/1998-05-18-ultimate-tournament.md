![\[Photo of UCSC ultimate team giving the high five\]][1] UCSC hosted the Western Regional Ultimate (frisbee) Collegiate Championship tournament May  9 and 10. Thirty-three men's and women's teams from British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, and Arizona came to compete for two berths to the National Final Championships. Here, Slugs (l-r) Ryan McEvoy, Jason Hakes, and Steve Stratton exchange high fives after a score against Stanford, which is ranked no. 1 in the nation. The Slugs gave Stanford its toughest game of the tournament, losing 9-8 in the final seconds.
