**Winning Themes Are California's Wild Plants, Gay Male Fiction, And  Iran**

SANTA CRUZ--Winners of the 28th Annual Book Collection Contest at  the University of California, Santa Cruz, were announced at an  awards ceremony held on Thursday, April 21, at McHenry Library. The  annual contest, which awards cash prizes to the top three  collections, is sponsored by the Friends of the UCSC Library.

Each year undergraduate and graduate students are invited to  submit a bibliography and essay on their collections, which must  consist of at least 25 titles and have a theme of clear significance  to their owners.

The $300 first prize went to Adrielle Anna Mitchell, a graduate  student in literature from New York City, for her entry, "Discovering  California's Wild Plants." The $200 second prize went to another  graduate student in literature, Marc Schachter of Corte Madera, for  his "Collection of Gay Male Fiction." The $100 third prize went to  College Eight undergraduate Arezou Shakernia of Millbrae for "Iran"- -a collection of books about her Persian heritage.

The ceremony began with brief remarks by the contest  coordinator, librarian Paul Machlis, followed by remarks from the  contest winners. Associate history professor Charles Hedrick gave a  talk on "How Not To Read." Hedrick was a contest judge, along with  Lee Duffus, vice president of the Friends of the UCSC Library, and  Victoria Welborn, head of the Science Library.

Along with annual sponsorship of the contest, the Friends of  the UCSC Library makes substantial gifts of books, films, and other  materials to the library that cannot be purchased through regular  budget funds.

Selections from the winning collections will be on display in  McHenry Library until May 13. For library hours and more  information, call (408) 459-2801.
