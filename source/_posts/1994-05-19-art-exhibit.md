SANTA CRUZ, CA--Sketches, drawings, and illustrations by world- renowned filmmaker Satyajit Ray, as well as personal memorabilia,  photographs, and movie posters will be on display at the University  of California, Santa Cruz, in Special Collections in the McHenry  Library. The exhibition runs through June 17.

Ray is considered one of the world's greatest filmmakers. He was admired throughout the world and was a national  hero in India. Shortly before he died he received an Oscar for  lifetime achievement. Ray made more than 40 feature-length films,  shorts, and documentaries and was an accomplished artist, novelist,  and musician. The works on display in Special Collections show the  depth and breadth of Ray's talents and provide insight into the  process Ray used in creating his films.

The exhibition includes Ray's sketchbooks, costume and set  designs, music manuscripts, and children's illustrations on loan  from Sandip Ray, Satyajit Ray's son. This is the first time these  items have been on display outside of India. Photos of the Ray  family, film stills, and movie posters from UCSC'S Ray Film and  Study Collection (Ray-FASC) archive round out the exhibit.

The Ray-FASC archive is housed in Special Collections at UC  Santa Cruz. Ray-FASC and a sister archive in Calcutta are part of an  international effort to restore and preserve the films of Satyajit Ray.

The exhibit is open to the public free of charge. Hours are  MondayÂ¯Friday, from 10 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m., with a special  Saturday showing on May 21 from 10 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m. For  more information, call Special Collections at (408) 459-2547.
