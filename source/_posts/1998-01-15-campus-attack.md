UCSC police are seeking information on an assault which reportedly took place in the backwoods in the northern end of the campus earlier this month.

A 37-year-old man was on a footpath past the north end of Red Hill Road when another man jumped out of the bushes and attacked him, the victim told the UCSC police on Sunday, January 4. There were no weapons involved.

The victim escaped and ran to a blue light phone at the North Remote Parking Lot, where he called police at 11:15 a.m.

The victim identified his assailant as a white male adult. He was unable to give any further information about the suspect due to the suddenness of the attack and his own quick escape, according to the police.

Members of the campus community are urged to be "especially aware of your surroundings" when alone in the backwoods, according to a Community Alert bulletin issued by the department. People should call the UCSC Police if they see any threatening incident or have an uncomfortable encounter in the backwoods.

Anyone with information about the January 4 assault should call the UCSC Police at (408) 459-2231. Those who wish to remain anonymous can call the TIP LINE at (408) 459-3TIP or send e-mail using the department's Web page at [www2.ucsc.edu/police][3].
