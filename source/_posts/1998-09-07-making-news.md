Sociologists have been in the news a lot lately. **Andy Szasz** got a lot of media attention for his study of environmental inequality in Santa Clara County. Coverage included CBS Radio News, Bay TV, KNTV in San Jose, KION-TV in Salinas, KSTS--the Spanish-language station in San Jose, KPFA Radio in Berkeley, and the _Santa Clara Weekly._ The _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ interviewed him, as did a reporter from the _San Jose Mercury News_\--and even one from a Viennese newspaper.

And **Dane Archer** did an interview for ABC's _20/20_ on interpersonal perception. He also fielded a call from Discovery Channel Online for a story they were preparing about facial attraction, pegged to an article that appeared in _Nature_.

Describing the fierce competition for rentals in Santa Cruz these days, history grad student **Jane Garcia** made a case for rent control in an op-ed published in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel._
