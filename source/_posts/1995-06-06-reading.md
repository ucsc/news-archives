SANTA CRUZ, CA--The public is invited to attend the annual meeting  of the Friends of the UCSC Library, which will feature readings by  some of the area's most prominent writers. The free event takes  place Thursday, June 15, at 4 p.m. under the cherry trees on the patio  north of McHenry Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

The program, titled "The Everson Legacy: A Literary Afternoon,"  features James Houston, Morton Marcus, Roz Spafford, and Gary  Young, who will read from works to be published in a special issue  of Quarry West, UCSC's literary magazine. The issue will be  published in honor of William Everson (1912-94), a master poet- printer and longtime resident of Santa Cruz. The program will be  moderated by Felicia Rice, owner of Moving Parts Press, and Ken  Weisner, editor of Quarry West.

Preceding the reading, there will be a brief business meeting,  including the election of new members of the board of directors.  Refreshments will be served.

An exhibit, "The William Everson Legacy," will also be  presented through the support of the Friends of the UCSC Library.  The exhibit, running June 12-July 12, features fine-press works and  other materials printed by Everson and poets and printers he  influenced.
