**Headliners Highlights Recent Media Coverage Involving Members Of The Ucsc Community.**

The rumblings and inner structure of our planet sparked several recent stories. Closest to the surface, seismologist **Susan Schwartz** told KCBA viewers about a "slow" earthquake on the San Andreas Fault that lasted a week. Further beneath our feet, the discovery of a partially molten layer at the base of earth's mantle led to spots on the "Earth and Sky" radio program and in the _Journal of College Science Teaching_ and _Clarin_, an Argentinean newspaper, for mineral physicist **Quentin Williams** and seismologist **Ed Garnero.** Finally, seismologist **Thorne Lay **discussed the deepest news of all with _New Scientist_, the _Los Angeles Times_, and the _San Jose Mercury News_: a finding that the inner core spins faster than the rest of the planet.

Reporting from the floor: Historian **Pedro Castillo** was interviewed several times by both the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ and the _Watsonville Register-Pajaronian_ while serving as a seventeenth Congressional District delegate at the Democratic convention this summer. Castillo also spoke with a reporter from the "News Hour with Jim Lehrer" on issues concerning Chicano/Latino studies.

Biologist **Dan Costa** updated readers of the _Los Angeles Times_ on the progress of ATOC, the ocean-sonar experiment that transmits sounds offshore from Half Moon Bay. Scientists have thus far seen no adverse effects on marine mammals. Also in the _L.A. Times_ was marine biologist **Don Croll, **one of several researchers studying blue whales off the southern California coast.

Research on the effects of oil spills on underwater organisms landed toxicologist **Ron Tjeerdema** and his team in the _Monterey County Herald_ and the _Orange County Register_.
