SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Monterey Bay Educational Consortium has  announced its priorities for the 1996 year and literacy tops the list,  followed closely by support for technology in schools, teacher  education, and building public support for education.

The priorities, which were announced by MBEC coordinator  Carrol Moran, will shape the activities of the consortium for the  rest of the year. The consortium's sixteen-member round table  recently identified the priorities, and project teams will help  implement the initiatives, says Moran.

The consortium encourages and supports collaborations among  the educational agencies of the Monterey Bay region, including the  University of California, Santa Cruz; California State University,  Monterey Bay; the four local community colleges; the county school  superintendents; and school district representatives (see attached  list of participants).

"Bringing the leaders of all levels of education into a  consortium like this is a unique concept," says Moran of UC Santa  Cruz. "There's a great deal of expertise and strength in the Monterey  Bay Area educational community. If we really bring people together  we can get tremendous things going that could never happen  independently."

MBEC members pledged to support early literacy efforts  because learning to read is the critical foundation of future success,  says Moran.

"Reading by third grade is a key indicator of success in the  school system," says Moran. "Traditionally, we haven't trained upper- grade teachers to work in early literacy development, so if kids fail,  there is no safety net." Most districts already recognize literacy as  a priority, says Moran, and MBEC will create a network to share  expertise across districts and will focus the resources of UCSC,  CSUMB, community colleges, and other community agencies on early  literacy.

Moran is beginning a special effort this winter to build a  Literacy Corps--a cadre of volunteers trained to work one-on-one  with struggling readers. Moran will help train students in the UCSC  teacher credentialing program, who will then work as reading tutors  in regional schools. In the spring, university students will have the  opportunity to become trainers of a student Literacy Corps in the  elementary and secondary schools. "Our goal is to support the  districts' effort to have all students become independent,  enthusiastic readers by the time they finish third grade," says  Moran. "One teacher with 35 children cannot do this alone. If we  train UCSC students and students in the schools to work as helpers,  we'd be contributing toward that goal."

In the area of science and technology, groups such as the  Monterey Bay Regional Education Futures Consortium are already  moving toward becoming a national model for collaboration, notes  Moran. MBEC's role will be to identify the different groups already  working in technology and telecommunications and to help bring  more resources to the Monterey Bay. The consortium will help ensure  that all students gain access to technology by facilitating  communication among schools and encouraging the sharing of  resources. MBEC could also provide the collaborative framework that  funding agencies look for, adds Moran.

"We want to bring more resources into the region, bring  schools up to speed on technology, and we want to help schools share  the expertise that is available," says Moran. "There are some  exciting technological collaborations happening between the public  schools and higher education, and we want to support that process  throughout the Monterey Bay Area."

In the area of teacher education, MBEC will support teacher and  administrative staff development. The consortium will initially  focus on assessment and evaluation by trying to bridge the gap  between traditional testing and grading practices and the latest  assessment tools, such as the use of rubrics and portfolios.

The area of student assessment has changed so much over the  years that it underscores the need for ongoing teacher support.  "Portfolios allow students to look at their own growth, set goals,  and show indicators that growth has occurred," says Moran. "It's a  really different approach for teachers. One of the challenges of  these new forms of assessment is weaving them into the  mainstream grading process."

Finally, MBEC wants to build public support for education and  will explore ways to encourage public discussion and increase public  awareness and understanding of education.

The consortium was established in 1994 to encourage  educational collaborations. Moran was hired in October to serve as  UCSC's liaison with K-12 education and as coordinator of MBEC.
