PASADENA, CA--The symptoms: Skin that shifts, cracks, and erupts.  The diagnosis: Stubborn lumps, hot and cold spots, and churnings  under the surface. The complexion of a pitiful adolescent? No, it is  the complexity of the upper layers of our planet earth, which seethe  with enough unrest to raise mountains, spout volcanoes, and unleash  devastating earthquakes.

Many geophysicists probe these layers, using seismic waves  from earthquakes as their x-rays. One powerful technique, "seismic  tomography," has flourished in the last decade as a means of  exploring three-dimensional structures within the earth.

Yu-Shen Zhang of the Institute of Tectonics at the University  of California, Santa Cruz, has emerged as a leading tomographer in  recent years. Zhang, a postgraduate research geophysicist, uses a  tomographic model called "RG5.5" that reveals subtle temperature  variations in the earth's interior at a level of detail surpassing  other models. For instance, RG5.5 has exposed:

Concentrated regions of hot and cold temperatures in the upper  mantle, the rocky part of the planet directly beneath its thin crust.  The hot regions underlie active areas such as midocean ridges,  where earth's oceanic crust forms; subduction zones, where the  crust is destroyed; and many of the isolated boils of volcanic  activity known as "hot spots."

Marked differences in the 3-D structures beneath midocean  ridges and hot spots.

Apparent connections between several hot spots and nearby  midocean ridges.

"The more we can understand these structures, the better we  can hope to predict future activity at the earth's surface," says  Zhang. He will discuss RG5.5 and present several applications during  a special session on global tomography on April 5 at a meeting of the  Seismological Society of America in Pasadena.

Zhang developed RG5.5 for his Ph.D. thesis at the California  Institute of Technology in 1991 with Toshiro Tanimoto, then at  Caltech and now at UC Santa Barbara. They have used RG5.5 to study  the earth with several colleagues, including Don Anderson of Caltech  and Thorne Lay, director of UCSC's Institute of Tectonics.

Here's how RG5.5 works: Earthquakes of magnitude 5.5 or  larger send seismic waves around the globe. Certain long-period  vibrations travel along the planet's surface but also penetrate  hundreds of kilometers into the upper mantle. The speed of each  wave depends on several factors, including the temperature of the  rock through which it travels. In general, the wave speeds up in cold  patches, where rock is brittle, and slows down in warm patches,  where rock flows more easily.

Computer analysis of many thousands of such seismic waves  can tease out these velocity changes for slices of the earth's mantle.  Although the relationship between temperature and velocity is not  exact, a difference in speed of just 1 percent in one patch might  translate to a temperature change of about 100 degrees celcius. By  putting the slices together, the researchers end up with 3-D maps of  hot and cold blobs.

Other tomographic techniques can detect such blobs only if  they are at least 3,000 kilometers across. That is sufficient to show  that the upper mantle has large swaths of warm and cold material.  However, RG5.5 can image regions just 1,000 kilometers across and  80 kilometers thick. This effectively lets Zhang and his colleagues  peel back the planet's crustal plates and look underneath at smaller  features in the upper mantle that contribute to tectonic activity at  the surface.

For instance, most models illuminate a close relationship  between extremely cold blobs in the upper mantle--where seismic  waves travel up to 5 percent faster than the global average--and the  most stable parts of continents at the planet's surface, such as  central Canada. It is harder to find a correspondence between hot  regions (up to 5 percent slower) and both hot spots and midocean  ridges. With RG5.5, Zhang and his colleagues find that  correspondence quite clearly. The effect is especially dramatic in  the mantle's uppermost 100 kilometers for the "ring of fire" around  the Pacific Ocean and for midocean ridges in the Atlantic and Indian  Oceans.

But there are differences in the structures under hot spots and  midocean ridges. RG5.5 shows that the low-velocity areas under  midocean ridges are very shallow: The hottest regions are less than  50 kilometers deep. According to Zhang, this may indicate that new  crust forms at ridges as a result of passive spreading of the oceanic  plates, not because of active upwelling of material from deep within  the mantle. Not all geophysicists agree with that conclusion, he  notes.

Under hot spots, such as Hawaii and Iceland, RG5.5 reveals  much deeper warm patches--as deep as 200 kilometers. This is  consistent with a theory that hot spots are the tops of narrow  "plumes" of volatile material from the deep mantle that break  through to the surface. However, RG5.5 does not see the plume  columns themselves--if they exist, they are too small to resolve.

Intriguingly, the different structures under hot spots and  midocean ridges appear linked. For instance, RG5.5 finds regions of  slow velocity between Hawaii and the East Pacific Rise, thousands  of kilometers away, and between several hot spots in the Atlantic  Ocean and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Channels in the mantle of an  unknown nature, says Zhang, may transport material from hot spots  to ridges.

Another interesting aspect of RG5.5 is its ability, in Zhang's  words, to "look back in time." Conditions at the surface of the earth  change far more quickly than in the mantle, where heat takes tens of  millions of years to dissipate. For instance, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge  has gradually migrated westward since the Pangaea supercontinent  broke up about 100 million years ago. Near the surface, RG5.5 shows  that the hottest regions of the mantle are under today's ridge.  Deeper in the mantle, however, heat from the ancient position of the  Mid-Atlantic Ridge still is visible as a "ghost ridge" hundreds of  kilometers to the east.

Zhang is now improving his model by including more earthquake  records and longer-period seismic waves that penetrate deeper into  the mantle. But even with finer resolution, he emphasizes, seismic  tomography will remain just one of several techniques with which  geophysicists can explore the roots of earth's unrest. "The inside of  the earth is so complicated," he says, "that we can't expect one  model to explain everything."
