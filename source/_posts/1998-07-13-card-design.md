title: New Design For Business Cards; Area Code Change
author: Elizabeth Irwin, Director of Public Information and Publications
---

With the campus area code having changed to 831 on Saturday, July 11, a six-month grace period has begun in which callers can use the old 408 code or the new code. To avoid any last-minute problems, campus units are advised against waiting until January 1999--when the grace period ends--to assess their publications, other materials, and equipment to make sure they incorporate the new 831 area code.

One item affected by the new area code is business cards, and many campus units are ordering new cards for faculty and staff.

If you have not yet placed an order, you should be aware of work that is nearly completed on a new official card for UCSC. The design of the new card will provide faculty and staff with a card that is more modern in appearance and more consistent with the typographical standards used in an increasing number of UCSC publications (print and online).

Chancellor Greenwood has approved the new design and will be ordering new cards for herself when the design is available through UCSC's business card contract.

Available in several options, the design can be viewed at the following Web address:

We anticipate that the new card options will be available through UCSC's business card vendor by the end of this month. So, if you're about to order new cards, please delay your action until UCSC's new card is available.

If your order is being processed by your Service Center, please consider recalling the order and purchasing one of the new official business cards.

Thank you very much.
