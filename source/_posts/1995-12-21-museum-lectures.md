April 10: "Why Do Communists Win Elections in Eastern Europe?,"  presented by history professor Peter Kenez.

In Lithuania, Hungary, and Slovakia, former communists are  stepping into top-ranking government posts, and in Russia, the  faction enjoying the highest approval rating is the Communist Party.  Kenez will explore the forces at play across Eastern Europe that are  bringing into power representatives of the party that was once so  reviled.

Kenez, who was born in Hungary, has studied the history of  Russia and the former Soviet Union. His books include The Birth of  the Propaganda State: Soviet Methods of Mass Mobilization, 1917- 1929 (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1985);  Cinema and Soviet Society, 1917-1953 (Cambridge; New York:  Cambridge University Press, 1992); and the autobiography Varieties  of Fear: Growing Up Jewish Under Nazism and Communism  (Washington, D.C.: American University Press, 1995).
