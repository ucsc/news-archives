The Millennium Committee plans to hold two events during winter quarter to solicit input from the campus community.

Faculty, staff, and students are invited to drop in at the Cowell Student Health Center Conference Room between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Tuesday, January 6, to discuss with members of the Millennium Committee their views of key principles for the future of the campus.

On Thursday, March 5, from 4 to 5:30 p.m., the committee plans to present its preliminary ideas and solicit feedback at a town meeting at Kresge Town Hall. (This meeting was originally scheduled to take place March 9.)

The Millennium Committee was appointed by Chancellor Greenwood in July to "articulate key principles that will serve as touchstones for all campus planning into the 21st century."
