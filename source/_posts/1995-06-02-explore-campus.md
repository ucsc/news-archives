SANTA CRUZ, CA--Summer is a terrific time of year to explore the  University of California, Santa Cruz, and its off-campus facilities.  Whether one wants to take a walk under the redwoods, visit a  working organic farm and garden, or tour a 100-year-old  mountaintop observatory, UCSC offers the opportunity. Admission is  free, unless otherwise noted.

The Arboretum Beautiful, colorful, and rare plants can be found on 40 acres at the  UCSC Arboretum. A research and teaching facility, the Arboretum is  home to a collection of Australian and South African plants not  available in any other American botanical garden.

The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily year-round,  except on Christmas. "Norrie's"--a gift shop selling plants, wreaths,  cut flowers, and books--is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10  a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. The Jean and Bill Lane  Horticultural Library, a nonlending library of horticultural and  botanical books, is open Wednesday through Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m.  The Arboretum is located on Empire Grade between the campus's  main and west entrances. For information, call (408) 427-2998. For  the gift shop, call (408) 423-4977.

Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems The Center for Agroecology manages two facilities: the 25-acre  Farm near the main entrance of campus and the 4-acre Alan  Chadwick Garden across McLaughlin Drive from Stevenson College.  Visitors to the Farm will find self-guided tour brochures at its  front gate. Docents lead tours of the Farm starting at the gate at  noon on Thursday and 2 p.m. on Sunday. Tours are canceled in the  event of rain. The Farm and Garden are open every day from 8 a.m. to  6 p.m. during the summer.

Starting mid-June, the Center for Agroecology will sell  organically grown produce and fresh flowers each Tuesday and  Friday from noon to 6 p.m. in front of the Barn Theater at the  intersection of Bay and High streets.

Trained docents answer questions and lead  tours Tuesday through Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. year-round, except on  holidays. Admission is free for individuals and small groups.
