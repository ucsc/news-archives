![\[Eduardo Carrillo's Vegetable Man\]][1] Black-and-white reproduction of "Vegetable Man," one of Eduardo Carrillo's works from 1997 (oil on canvas).

A memorial exhibition of the works of the late Eduardo Carrillo runs from Wednesday, March 4, through Saturday, April 25, at the Sesnon Art Gallery at Porter College. A public reception takes place on Friday, March 6, from 5 to 7 p.m.

Carrillo's death in July 1997 at the age of 60 ended a long and respected career in art and education. A UCSC professor since 1972, Carrillo was also a nationally recognized painter and muralist. His work was exhibited in countless solo and group shows in museums and galleries throughout the U.S. and Latin America, portraying themes of Chicano history, culture, art, and religion.

Carrillo taught drawing, art history, shadow puppetry, mural, fresco, and--his primary focus--oil and watercolor painting. He created set designs for local theater productions, brought art programs to children and teenagers, and supported emerging artists in the Beach Flats area.

Gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 5 p.m. The gallery is wheelchair accessible and admission is free. For more information, call (408) 459-2314.
