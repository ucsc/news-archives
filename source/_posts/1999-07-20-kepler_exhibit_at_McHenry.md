## Exhibit Highlights Discovery Of Rare Manuscript By Famous Astronomer

SANTA CRUZ, CA-An exhibit currently on display at McHenry Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz, celebrates the rediscovery and global distribution of one of the University Library's most important treasures-a horoscope written by Johannes Kepler, considered one of the greatest astronomers of all time.

A reception is planned on Thursday, July 22, at 4 p.m., in the McHenry Library exhibit area. Anthony Misch, the astronomer who discovered the manuscript, will speak, as will librarian Alan Ritch The reception is sponsored by the Friends of the UCSC Library and is free and open to the public. Refreshments will be served.

More on the exhibit: Several "contexts" are revealed and explored in this exhibit: "The Meaning of the Manuscript," in the two upright cases, displays large copies of the horoscope, describes its importance, traces its provenance, and interprets its contents. Two cases of items from the Shane Archive show, respectively, the context of the discovery in a drawer of framed pictures and the labor-intensive creation of descriptive records necessary to organize an archive and make its contents visible. "The Manuscript in the Media" displays more than 50 articles about the discovery.

The remaining four cases display other facets of the story: "Astrology as Protoscience" looks at the pivotal period when great astronomers like Kepler were casting horoscopes; "Astrology in Academia" uses a sampler from the University Library to reflect on a wide variety of scholarly approaches to the topic; "The Art of Astrology" shows the stars and planets in the visual imagery of the Renaissance; and "Astrology in Renaissance Literature" shows "starry" literary references, including sonnets and plays by Kepler's English contemporary, Shakespeare.
