An excerpt from an upcoming book by psychologist **William Domhoff** was featured in the March/April issue of _Mother Jones._ The book (coauthored with Richard Zweigenhaft, a UCSC alumnus) is _Diversity in the Power Elite: Have Women and Minorities Reached the Top?_ (Yale University Press, 1998).

UCSC admissions counselor **Hilda Hernandez-Meza** was interviewed for the show _Adelante con Educacion_ on radio station "La Unica"-670 AM in Los Angeles. Hernandez-Meza discussed her experience as a Latina UCSC student, an alumna, and admissions counselor and also discussed financial aid at UCSC.

Poet **Peter Gizzi's** new book _Artificial Heart_ has been featured locally in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ and the _Watsonville Register-Pajaronian_ and also received an online review from the _New York Review of Books_ in which the critic notes that Gizzi's style has "led to the writing of a very good book of poems." Gizzi's other new book, a critical work on poet Jack Spicer, was featured as the cover story in the January/February issue of the _American Poetry Review_ and is being reviewed in an upcoming issue of _Lingua Franca._ That book is due out in May.

Anthropologist **Alison Galloway** was pictured on the front page of the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ in connection with a story on a 100-year-old skeleton found in the woods in Felton. By looking at the size and shape of specific bones, Galloway was able to provide clues to the individual's identity and history. The story was also covered by the _San Jose Mercury News._

It's been a busy spring for political scientist **Gwendolyn Mink.** Most recently, Mink wrote a piece--"Misreading the Sexual Harassment Law"--that appeared on the _New York Times'_ op-ed page. Citing the dismissive responses by some feminists to recent harassment complaints against Bill Clinton, Mink observes that the fact "that so many feminists don't appreciate the distinction between welcomeness and consent bodes ill for sexual harassment law." Mink was also tapped by Knight-Ridder News Service to give her opinion on the court decision in Paula Jones's suit against Clinton. And, as if that wasn't enough, Mink was the subject of a feature in the _Chronicle of Higher Education_ for her new book, _Welfare's End_ (Cornell University Press, 1998).
