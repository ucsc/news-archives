![Matthew Henken][1]

**Matthew Henken:** Assistant Professor of Philosophy

Matthew Henken comes to UCSC from Dartmouth College, where he taught philosophy last year. His work focuses on epistemology and metaphysics as well as the philosophy of language, the history of philosophy, and the philosophy of mind. Henken's recent research concerns philosophical skepticism about necessity and morality. He received his B.A. in philosophy from Dartmouth College and a Ph.D. in philosophy from UC Berkeley.

![Michael Wenger][2]

**Michael Wenger:** Assistant Professor of Psychology

Michael Wenger is an experimental psychologist whose work explores the ways in which people perceive and remember information. Specifically, he is investigating how perception and memory work in allowing us to process faces (and other objects) and to become skilled. For example, people--even infants--recognize faces with remarkable speed and accuracy, and Wenger's experiments examine the fundamental characteristics of how this might happen. Many of the sophisticated theoretical tools he uses to interpret his findings have been developed in only the past 5-10 years. Wenger comes to UCSC from a two-year postdoctoral appointment at Indiana University. He earned his B.S. and M.S. from the University of Washington and his Ph.D. in experimental psychology from SUNY at Binghamton.
