author: Barbara McKenna

The Division of Arts is hosting a ceremony to dedicate the Siegfried Puknat Teaching and Practice Studios, named in memory of Siegfried Puknat, professor of German and comparative literature, and his wife, Elisabeth Mignon Puknat. The dedication is free and open to the public and takes place at 5 p.m. on Saturday, October 18, on Kretschmer Plaza at the UCSC Music Center. A reception follows.

Siegfried "Sig" Berthold Puknat died March 17 in San Francisco. He was 83. Puknat, who came to the campus in 1964 as one its first faculty members, was deeply involved in planning and forming the vision of the campus during his 18-year career at UCSC.

Among his many roles, Puknat served as chair of the Music Department during 1967-70 and again, for one quarter following his retirement in 1987. Puknat's investment in the Music Department continued well past his tenure as chair and in his will he left a major portion of his estate to both the music and literature programs. The funds for music will be used to support music performance. Puknat's gift is part of the $1 million UCSC Music Campaign, established to raise support for music scholarships, equipment, and performance and operating expenses.

Those wishing to attend the dedication should RSVP by Oct. 15 to the Arts Development Office at (408) 459-3277.
