Garden manager **Orin Martin** was tapped for an article in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ about growing flowers for bouquets in home gardens. Martin took gardening editor Kathy Kreiger on a tour of the Chadwick Garden, pointing out plant varieties and sharing tips on growing, picking, and drying flowers for cutting. He'll give a free talk on growing cut flowers on Saturday, May 30, from 10 a.m. to noon at San Lorenzo Garden Center on River Street in Santa Cruz.

Astronomer **Stan Woosley** was asked for comment on a story in the _San Jose Mercury News_ about a huge explosion in the universe, second only to the "big bang," that took place 12 million years ago, now detectable by powerful telescopes in space and on the ground.
