All the colloquia will be held on Mondays from 3:30 to 4:40 p.m. in Room 152, Stevenson College. The speakers in the colloquium represent a broad range of perspectives on ecological philosophy. Among the questions they will address are: What does it mean to "think Green?" Are Green politics and environmentalism the same? If not, how do they differ? What are the philosophical bases of Green thought? Was Hobbes a closet Green? Do Green political parties have any chance of gaining power, or are they doomed to opposition? What does it mean to be biocentric? Is sustainable development feasible or a fantasy? What do Green political programs propose to do? The colloquium is open to the public, and students may register for one unit of credit. (The colloquium is linked to Politics 114, _Thinking Green: Politics, Ethics, Political Economy, Mondays and Wednesdays,_ 5-6:45, 110 Social Sciences 1.)
