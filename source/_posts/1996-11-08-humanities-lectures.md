author: Barbara McKenna

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Mary-Kay Gamel, associate professor of classics,  comparative literature, and theater arts at UC Santa Cruz, will  present the talk "Ancient Drama: The Difference Women Make" from 7  to 8 p.m. on Thursday, November 14, at the Museum of Art and  History at the McPherson Center, 705 Front St., Santa Cruz. The talk  is free and open to the public. A reception follows.

Gamel's talk is a part of the Humanities Lecture Series,  presented jointly by the Humanities Division at UCSC and the  Museum of Art and History.

Since 1985 Gamel has staged nearly a dozen performances of  classical Greek plays at UCSC, many of which she translated herself.  Her talk will include video clips from those productions illustrating  what effect a modern feminist perspective has in finding meanings  in ancient texts. Rather than stage what she describes as "museum"  productions--those that try to recreate the play as it was first  produced--Gamel presents the plays in a modern context. Her  production of Ajax was set in the Vietnam War era, Electra was  staged in a modern ghetto, and Medea took place in McCarthy-era  Hollywood.

"I'm trying to ask questions about conventionally held  assumptions and examine texts from contemporary perspectives,"  Gamel said. "Museum productions are often as theatrically deadly as  they are politically questionable. Performance always takes place  within history, and even the most scrupulous museum productions  are stamped with the signs of their own times."
