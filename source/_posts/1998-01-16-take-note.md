**Two recent changes to the Family School Partnership Act apply to university employees.** Under the changes, which took effect January 1, university employees may take off up to 40 hours each year to participate in the school activities of their children in kindergarten or grades 1 through 12. Previously, state law allowed employees to take off up to 40 hours per "school year." Also, employees who have custody of a child attending a licensed child day care facility are now entitled to take up to 40 hours off work each year to participate in the facility's activities. An employee must give reasonable notice of the planned absence and may be asked to provide certification from the child's school. Covered activities include PTA meetings, parent/teacher conferences, and field trips. If accrued leave is not available, employees may use leave without pay.
