SANTA CRUZ, CA--Professor Ray T. Collett, director of the Arboretum at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, received the California Horticultural  Society Annual Award in San Francisco on Monday, February 3. Collett was  honored for his lifelong contributions to California horticulture, including  establishing the UCSC Arboretum, introducing new plants to California  gardens, and breeding new forms of popular plants.

Collett, who came to UCSC in 1965, is one of the campus's original  faculty members. As the Arboretum's founding director, he has overseen the  conversion of about 130 acres of rough pastures into a leading horticultural  site. The Arboretum is renowned for its collections of Australian and New  Zealand plants--the most extensive such collections outside of their native  countries. The gardens also contain the largest collection of South African  protea relatives outside of South Africa and one of the largest collections of  conifer genera in the world.

Collett is credited with popularizing the Australian "blue" hibiscus in  California, in part through the development of a superior, dark purple  compact form known as Alyogyne huegelii 'Swan River,' a.k.a. 'Monterey Bay.'  This variety is so popular that cultivators in Australia now grow Collett's  selection as well. Another successful selection is a particular California  fuchsia, Epilobium (Zauschneria) 'Hurricane Point,' that was collected as a  cutting before the portion of Hurricane Point containing the parent plant  slipped into the Pacific Ocean along Big Sur. Collett's most recent  introductions are Correa 'Dawn in Santa Cruz' (now being taken to England),  Correa 'Sister Dawn,' and Mimulus 'Ray's Yellow.'

Even before the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s, Collett worked on  drought-tolerant plants that have now become part of the California  landscape. Several of the 109 "Best New Plants" for the latest edition of the  Sunset Western Garden Book are grevilleas and other species selected or  introduced by the UCSC Arboretum. Fremontia, the journal of the California  Native Plant Society, often mentions Arboretum selections of California  natives introduced during Collett's tenure.

Among the other widespread plants popularized or introduced by the  Arboretum are Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon,' Scaevola 'Mauve Clusters,' South  African proteas, and pincushion proteas. In addition to plants suitable for  landscaping, Collett has been instrumental in introducing many new species  useful to the cut-flower industry. Going against an economic trend, some  types of plants formerly imported on a large scale can now be grown in  California, thanks largely to the efforts of Collett and the Arboretum.

The California Horticultural Society produces a newsletter and a  widely respected magazine, Pacific Horticulture, for which Collett has  written several articles. The society was founded in 1933 and has 650  members.

The Arboretum is located on Empire Grade in Santa Cruz between the  east and west entrances to the UCSC campus. It is open to the public from 9  A.M. to 5 P.M. daily. Norrie's Gifts at the Arboretum is open for plant, book,  and gift sales on Tuesday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to  4 P.M. and Sunday from 1 to 4 P.M.
