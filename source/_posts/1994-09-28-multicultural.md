title: Multicultural Education Is One Key To Breaking Through Racial Polarization In California, Says Leading Scholar
author: Jennifer McNulty

SANTA CRUZ, CA--As racial polarization grows and the backlash  against immigrants and welfare families intensifies, the University  of California has an obligation to develop multicultural courses to  foster greater understanding of the diversity of the American  experience.

That's the view of Ronald Takaki, a professor of ethnic studies  at the University of California, Berkeley, and a leading scholar on  the issues of race and culture. Takaki will give a free public lecture  at UC Santa Cruz titled "A Different Mirror: A Multicultural  Curriculum for the 21st Century," on Monday, October 17, at 7 p.m. in  Classroom Unit 1. A book signing and reception will follow.

Takaki sees the recent hostility toward immigrants and the  poor as an outgrowth of the state's economic hard times and fears  that such scapegoating is polarizing a critical "national  conversation" about how people from diverse ethnic and racial  communities can learn to get along.

"I think of the night of April 19, 1992, when the fires were  burning in Los Angeles and we watched the violent melee in the  streets," says Takaki. "I remember the face of Rodney King and his  trembling words, 'We can work it out. Can't we all just get along?'  But how do we work it out? That's where the University of  California has an obligation and an opportunity to help Californians  learn about one another."

The key to better racial and ethnic understanding will require  an improved economy, strong political leadership, and multicultural  education, says Takaki, but education becomes even more critical in  times when the economy is weak and political leaders are  capitalizing on racial divisions.

At UC Berkeley, Takaki helped pioneer the introduction of an  American Cultures requirement that was enacted in 1991. To  graduate, each undergraduate must take one course with a  multicultural focus. So far, at least 26 academic departments have  developed 80 courses, including classes in music, architecture,  political science, business administration, public policy, philosophy,  and forest and resource management.

"We need to understand our diversity from a pluralistic  perspective," says Takaki. "We need a comparative approach to  America's racial and ethnic diversity, and we need to understand the  ways the paths of different groups have crisscrossed each other."

At UC Berkeley, the administration committed $300,000 in  start-up funds to establish the Institute for Teaching of American  Cultures and offered stipends to encourage faculty to participate in  monthlong summer seminars to expand their knowledge. A parallel  seminar has been established for community college faculty. The  institute has attracted major outside funding from foundations, but  Takaki notes that outside funds are temporary and the institute's  future is uncertain given the state's ongoing budget crisis.

Takaki concedes that requiring students to take one course  isn't enough, but he says it provides an introduction to understanding  American society in terms of race and ethnicity. "We established the  requirement for intellectual reasons, and the budget crisis is  worrisome because we're standing at the threshold of revitalizing  the humanities and social sciences," says Takaki.

The "Berkeley model" has been replicated at the University of  Washington, and the University of Michigan has a similar  requirement, says Takaki. The comparative multicultural approach  provides an alternative to the two dominant branches of the  discussion, which Takaki sums up as "Eurocentric exclusionism,"  which calls for a reaffirmation of Western Civilization, and "ethnic  particularism," which places the emphasis on individual ethnic  groups and fosters ethnic nationalism. "I think there's a third way to  look at the issue," says Takaki, whose books include "A Different  Mirror: A History of Multicultural America" (Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1993).

Takaki's lecture is the first this academic year in the  Chancellor's Distinguished Seminar Series on Mission, Quality, and  Diversity, established one year ago by UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister  and the Academic Senate. The seminars are the public part of a  program in which prominent women and minorities spend a day with  faculty and students to discuss how to improve the quality of higher  education in the United States.
