Indian media in the U.S. and abroad covered a recent trip to India by a UCSC delegation. **Chancellor Greenwood,** who led the delegation, was the focus of a number of stories as a result of her address to the Indian Science Congress, held in Hyderabad. Greenwood's speech focused on issues concerning scientific collaboration between India and UC, was covered by Hyderabad's _Indian Express_ and the _Hindu Business Line,_ and sparked a feature story a few days later in the _Indian Express_ of New Delhi. _India West,_ a U.S.-based newspaper, also covered the news of the delegation's trip.

Research physicist **Michael Riordan** has received extensive media attention for his book on the history of the transistor and the microchip, _Crystal Fire: The Birth of the Information Age_ (coauthored with Lillian Hoddeson). An article he wrote on the invention of the transistor appeared on the front page of the Horizon section of the _Washington Post,_ and he was interviewed on NPR's _Talk of the Nation/Science Friday_ and _Morning Edition _programs. Riordan was also quoted extensively in a _San Francisco Examiner_ story on the 50th anniversary of the invention of the transistor.

Psychology's **Roland Tharp** appeared on the _NewsHour with Jim Lehrer_ last fall, discussing bilingual education.

**Brent Haddad** of environmental studies was quoted in a _Salinas Californian_ article about California's planned electricity deregulation.
