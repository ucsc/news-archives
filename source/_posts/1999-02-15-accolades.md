**Peter Gizzi,** assistant professor of literature, has been recognized as an outstanding artist by the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts in New York. Thirteen artists in dance, music, theater, poetry, and the visual arts were named and will each receive an unrestricted grant of $25,000 to support their artistic endeavors.

The Foundation for Contemporary Arts was founded in 1963 by artist Jasper Johns and composer John Cage with the aim of supporting and encouraging outstanding and unusually promising artists. Artists are selected through a selective nomination and screening process. Gizzi was one of only four artists outside of New York to be recognized this year (the other three were from England, Poland, and Connecticut).

Gizzi is the author of _Artificial Heart_ (1998), _The House that Jack Built: The Collected Lectures of Jack Spicer_ (1998), and _Periplum, or, I the Blaze_ (1992).
