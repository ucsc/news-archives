Natural Reserve manager and environmental studies lecturer **Maggie Fusari** penned an op-ed for the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ tackling some of the key points of opposition to locating a new natural history museum at Lighthouse Field. A past president of the Santa Cruz Natural History Museum Association, Fusari argues that "a well sited and designed museum would improve the natural values of Lighthouse Field . . . providing vital environmental stewardship for the parklands."

The work of paleobotanist **Scott Wing,** a visiting lecturer at UCSC this year, was featured in a recent story in the _Sentinel._ Wing researches climatic conditions and notes that by understanding the causes of warm weather on earth millions of years ago (when crocodiles were found as far north as Wyoming) we can gain insight on how our climate works today.
