A new book on three blues matriarchs garnered more news coverage this week for its author, hist. con.'s **Angela Davis**. A feature story in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ preceded a downtown talk by Davis. Shortly after that story came out, Davis spoke with a reporter from France's _Le Figaro_ for a story on how the world has changed in the past three decades. Also being interviewed for the story are Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Czech Republic president Vaclav Havel, and Vietnamese general Vo Nguyen Giap.

Professor emeritus of physics **Matthew Sands** was profiled in an article in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel._

**Brent Haddad** of environmental studies was one of four water experts who came together for a public discussion of what to do about alarming groundwater depletion in Santa Cruz County, reported the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel._ South County residents will have to decide in June whether or not to pipe in imported water to meet increasing demands. In Haddad's opinion, linking with the state water system is technically possible but not very feasible; he favors a combination of alternative strategies.
