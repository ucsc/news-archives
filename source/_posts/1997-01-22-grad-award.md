SANTA CRUZ, CA--Rarely is an undergraduate student listed as an  author in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, one  of the country's leading scientific journals. Scott Seiwert, a former  UC Santa Cruz biology student who managed that uncommon feat, has  secured yet another distinction: the prestigious 1996 Pharmacia  Biotech & Science Prize for Young Scientists.

Seiwert, now a 30-year-old Ph.D. recipient, was awarded the  $20,000 international prize in molecular biology for an essay  explaining the significance of his doctoral work at Yale University.  Seiwert's research involved trypanosomes, single-celled primitive  organisms that pose a threat to world health. Trypanosomes are  responsible for tropical diseases that affect 30 million people a  year, such as African sleeping sickness. Seiwert demonstrated how  the microorganism's RNA, a cousin of DNA, transfers genetic  information.

Pharmacia Biotech and the scientific journal Science  cosponsor the annual prize, which recognizes the most outstanding  thesis in molecular biology from students around the world, as  described in a 1,000-word essay. As part of the award, Seiwert's  essay, "RNA Editing Hints of a Remarkable Diversity in Gene  Expression Pathways," was published in a recent issue of Science.

Seiwert first learned about trypanosomes as an undergraduate  working in the lab of Manuel Ares, an associate professor of biology  at UCSC. Ares published the results of that work in the Proceedings  of the National Academy of Sciences--with Seiwert as second  author. Undergraduate participation in the leading research programs  of the faculty is a hallmark of UCSC education. Ares,  who was himself mentored as an undergraduate at Cornell, takes  pride in Seiwert's latest accomplishment. "He needed only a little  discipline and focus to get started," recalls Ares, "and after that his  energy and enthusiasm for science took over. It turns out he's pretty  good at it."

Seiwert was a Thimann Scholar at UCSC who earned his B.S. in  biochemistry and molecular biology in 1989. He won the prize while  conducting his postdoctoral research at the Seattle Biomedical  Research Institute. As of January 1, he moved to the University of  Colorado, Boulder, where he received a fellowship to continue his  work.
