The environmental review process for a proposed parking structure on Science Hill moved forward last week with a public hearing at Classroom Unit 1.

More than 60 members of the UCSC and Santa Cruz communities turned out to comment on the draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the parking structure.

"This was the largest public hearing turnout we've had for a campus project in the last four or five years," said Christine Aldecoa, director of UCSC's Environmental Assessment Group. "The project is obviously of interest to people."

The six-story parking structure is currently proposed to be built on an existing parking lot at the intersection of Heller and McLaughlin Drives. As proposed, it would provide approximately 500 spaces. The lowest deck of the structure would be built below ground level.

Approximately 210 of the new spaces provided by the proposed parking structure would replace existing spaces expected to be lost when the parking structure itself and the Physical Sciences Building are built in the area.

The public hearing on the project EIR brought out people from all segments of the campus community, a half dozen west side Santa Cruz residents, a city council member, and other interested parties.

People who spoke out against the project brought up a variety of issues, including concerns about increased traffic, the use of undergraduate parking fees to pay for the structure, and noise levels during construction and afterward.

"It's sending the wrong message to have the largest parking lot in the county on a campus that is known for its creative solutions to transportation problems," said associate researcher Erik Asphaug.

In addition to those who expressed concerns, a few members of the campus community spoke out in support of the project.

"We need to come up with better alternatives (than single-passenger vehicles), but we also need to come up with alternatives for people who already can't find places to park on campus," said professor of biology Daniel Costa.

Costa added that public transportation is not feasible for many new faculty members who live far from UCSC because of the cost of housing near the campus.

Several people expressed support for some of the alternatives analyzed in the draft EIR, including increased and improved bus service and the development of park-and-ride lots off campus.

Richard Stover, research astronomer for UCO/Lick Observatory, proposed an alternative to the parking structure that drew applause from the audience.

Stover proposed that the university raise parking fees without building the parking structure.

"At the end of the year, the university holds a lottery (with surplus funds from the parking fees), and 20 faculty, students, and staff each get $20,000," said Stover. "I think you could get a lot of faculty and staff to sign up for the chance."

**Comment period remains open for the Environmental Impact Report**

Members of the public may continue to submit written comments on the draft Environmental Impact Report until 5 p.m. on Monday, April 5. Written comments should be submitted to Christine Aldecoa, Environmental Assessment Group, Physical Planning and Construction, Barn G.

Copies of the draft EIR are available at the reserve desk at McHenry Library or at the Santa Cruz Central Library on 224 Church St. in Santa Cruz; copies may also be purchased from the UCSC Environmental Assessment Group for the cost of duplication. For more information or to request a copy of the draft EIR, call (831) 459-4407 or (831) 459-4760.

Following public review, a final EIR will be prepared that responds to the comments received. The Regents will review and consider the final EIR before deciding to approve, revise, or reject the proposed project. The Regents are expected to consider the project in June.

If approved, construction is scheduled to start this summer and be completed by summer 2000.
