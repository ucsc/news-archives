title: Toxic Algae Found In Monterey Bay Food Web

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Pelicans and cormorants often gather in shallow  water near Santa Cruz. But in the summer of 1991, one such  gathering took a bizarre and tragic twist. The birds seemed  intoxicated, swimming in circles and squawking pitifully. Over the  next few weeks, more than 100 carcasses of seabirds washed ashore  near Santa Cruz.

After an intense search, scientists eventually identified the  culprit: a natural poison never before detected in California waters.  Now, researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have  discovered that the algae responsible for the poison are regular  inhabitants of Monterey Bay. It appears the poison can spread  throughout the food chain, from mussels and clams to fish and  seabirds--and potentially to humans.

The poison, domoic acid, is produced by a marine phytoplankton  species, Pseudo-nitzschia australis. In strong doses, domoic acid  can cause severe stomach distress, brain damage, and even death. In  1987, more than 100 Canadians on Prince Edward Island became  seriously ill after eating mussels tainted with domoic acid. Several  patients developed dementia and amnesia. Four died.

David Garrison, an associate research biologist at UCSC's  Institute of Marine Sciences, says a similar catastrophe is unlikely  in Monterey Bay. However, he says, domoic acid still has the  potential to cause human health problems. "We're not saying this  will happen, but you can't rule it out," he says.

The chief causes of concern: Domoic acid is surprisingly  common in Monterey Bay, and it spreads quickly. Algae such as  Pseudo-nitzschia form the base of the food chain, and each animal in  the chain can pass the poison to the next link. Graeme Haywood, a  graduate student at UCSC, has found domoic acid in every animal  species he has investigated, including several types of zooplankton,  eight species of fish, mussels, and clams.

Garrison sees a need for increased awareness of the health  risks of domoic acid. The California Department of Health Services  currently monitors mussels for domoic acid, but Garrison feels their  methods aren't sensitive enough. "We can find the toxin in the algae  when they can't detect it in the mussels," he says.

Garrison believes that commercial seafood on the West Coast  is adequately monitored for domoic acid. However, he says, the  pismo clams, anchovies, sea scallops, and rock crabs that end up in  sport fishermen's buckets might pose a health risk. These animals  are not tested for domoic acid, and researchers don't know how much  poison the animals might retain. Also unknown are the possible  health hazards of eating low levels of domoic acid over long periods  of time.

Once researchers realized Monterey Bay supported a  potentially toxic species of algae, they started carefully following  its growth patterns. Garrison and his graduate student Peter Walz  have regularly found Pseudo-nitzschia australis in Monterey Bay  waters. Over the last three years, the algae have bloomed about  twice a year, with each bloom lasting one to three weeks.

Walz and Garrison were surprised to find that one recent bloom  didn't seem to produce domoic acid. They suspect the bloom  consisted of a nontoxic strain of Pseudo-nitzschia, but it's possible  the algae turn the poison on and off in response to unknown  environmental signals.

Haywood, who studies under professor of marine sciences Mary  Silver, took research back through time by searching for domoic acid  in preserved samples dating as far back as 1977. He says the bay has  been tinged with the poison at least twelve out of the last seventeen  years, and he's confident that it was present long before 1977.

For one thing, Haywood says, birds have become sick and  demented several other times in the history of Monterey Bay.  Perhaps the most noteworthy event occurred in 1961, when flocks of  shearwaters began madly attacking residents of Rio Del Mar. "That  looks very much like a domoic acid event," says Garrison. Soon  afterward, Alfred Hitchcock announced plans to turn the incident  into a movie--yes, it appears that "The Birds" suffered from domoic  acid poisoning.

The impact of the poison apparently depends both on the size  and the timing of the bloom, says Silver. The deadly bloom in 1991  was larger than normal, and it coincided with the arrival of schools  of anchovies in the bay. The anchovies ate the algae, and the  cormorants and pelicans ate the anchovies. "A series of events has  to happen for there to be a real problem," she says.

Several major questions about domoic acid in Monterey Bay  remain. Researchers don't know what triggers blooms of Pseudo- nitzschia or why the algae produce the toxin. Garrison says frequent,  careful measurements of the blooms is the first step to answering  these questions.

Other UCSC researchers have taken different approaches to  studying domoic acid. Ronald Tjeerdema, an associate professor of  chemistry and biochemistry, is studying how mussels, crabs, and  anchovies accumulate the toxin. Chris Scholin, a visiting researcher  at the Institute of Marine Sciences, is developing a genetic test that  will allow scientists to detect Pseudo-nitzschia cells quickly and  accurately.

Garrison and Silver's research is supported by California Sea  Grant.
