![\[Photo of student protest\]][1] Calling for an end to U.S. intervention in Iraq and in the Middle East, a group of UCSC students rallied on campus and marched downtown Wednesday, February 25. More than 100 students gathered in the Bay Tree Bookstore parking lot around 1 p.m. They stopped at all of the colleges before heading toward the town clock, where 50 of them arrived shortly after 4 p.m. The protest was organized by the Student Coalition Against the War Drive in Iraq.
