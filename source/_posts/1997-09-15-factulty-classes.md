TO UCSC FACULTY:

Based on input from faculty, we are offering the following seminars and clinics in September to facilitate integrating technology into teaching and learning. These are offered as follow-up activities to the Spring '97 Systemwide conference on "Teaching, Learning, and the New Technologies". CATS Instructional Computing and the Library's Media Services are co-sponsoring these hands-on workshops and seminars.

There are short customized clinics for faculty novices which will be held throughout September, and two full days of seminars for faculty on Monday, September 22 and Tuesday, September 23.

In addition, for Fall, 1997 we are planning a workshop series for faculty which takes them through the steps of creating web sites, particularly course web sites. This is described at the end of this announcement.

Please RSVP for these workshops to Jennifer Goodheart, lucille@cats.ucsc.edu, to let us know which workshops and seminars you want to attend. You will receive confirmation of enrollment status via email. If the seats aren't filled by faculty on the day of the workshops, staff who directly support computing in instruction will be enrolled. There is no charge for these workshops.

SHORT SESSIONS: GAINING COMPUTER LITERACY SKILLS: FOR FACULTY NOVICES AT GROUND ZERO

Do you consider yourself a novice at "ground zero"? Would you like to learn to use a Mac or a PC, including topics such as how to use a mouse, basic skills in how to use Eudora email, how to begin to browse the Web... in a group of 2-3 faculty who are at a similar level? For the month of September we are arranging small one-hour custom-tailored clinics for faculty who want to learn but need some guidance in getting started. If you are faculty, and are interested in participating in a one-hour session covering basic skills, call Jennifer Goodheart, CATS Instructional Computing, at x95651 to discuss what you want to accomplish. Faculty with similar learning interests will be invited to participate in these small, short (and gentle) clinics led by Alicia Marquez and Jennifer Goodheart, CATS Instructional Computing. No prerequisites.
