Clinton's legacy

Gwendolyn Mink, professor of politics, specializes in U.S. politics, including women, welfare policy, labor politics, and the Democratic Party. She is the author of the new book Hostile Environment: The Political Betrayal of Sexually Harassed Women, in which she chronicles the erosive power the Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky scandals had on sexual harassment law. Mink asserts that one of Bill Clinton's most lasting legacies will be the silencing effect these cases have on the majority of sexually harassed women, who, having seen the "regime of disbelief" that surrounds sexual harassment claims, will opt not to exercise their legal rights to seek redress.
