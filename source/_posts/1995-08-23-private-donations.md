SANTA CRUZ, CA--More than $9 million in private gift and grant  support was received by the University of California, Santa Cruz,  during the fiscal year that ended June 30--the highest total  recorded in the campus's 30-year history, according to the  Development Office. The total was up more than 58 percent from the  previous year, when $5.84 million was contributed to campus  programs, scholarships, and fellowships.

In the 1994-95 year, the campus raised $9.26 million, $1 million more than in 1991-92, the campus's previous best private  fund-raising year.

"We are delighted that there has been such significant growth  in private support this year," said Daniel G. Aldrich III, assistant  chancellor for University Advancement at UCSC. The gifts funded aid  for students, supported research, and established three faculty  endowed chairs, he said.

"These gifts enable UCSC to continue to open its doors to its  students; assist research that is vital not only to the expansion of  knowledge but also for the continuing development of a vibrant  instructional program; and acknowledge distinguished current  faculty and attract aspiring new faculty in future years," Aldrich  said.

The bulk of the funding came from the following sources:  alumni and parents, 11.9 percent; individuals other than alumni and  parents, 32 percent; foundations, 33.3 percent; and the business  sector, 14 percent. Other sources included community organizations,  trusts and bequests, and campus organizations.

Major private gifts or grants received on campus during the  past year included:

* A $1 million gift from the David and Lucile Packard  Foundation to UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS), which  created the Endowment for Ocean Science and Technology. Income  from the endowment will help fund collaborative projects by marine  scientists at UCSC, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute  (MBARI), and other research organizations.
* A gift of $250,000 from World War II refugee Anne Neufeld  Levin, establishing the Neufeld-Levin Holocaust Chair. The chair,  which will have an interdisciplinary focus, is one of just a few  chairs of holocaust studies in the United States. To complement the  establishment of the chair, Levin also donated extensive family  archives of holocaust-related materials.
* A $250,000 gift from Dr. Alan G. and Margaret ("Meg") Lyons  Giberson, which established the Pepper-Giberson Endowed Chair in  Environmental Studies. The endowed chair honors longtime faculty  member James Pepper, while at the same time demonstrating the  Gibersons' support for environmental education and protection.
* The UC Santa Cruz Foundation Chair in Psychology was  established with endowment funds from the UC Santa Cruz  Foundation and chancellor's discretionary funds. The chair was  established to support teaching, research, and public service related  to psychology at UCSC, with the first chair holder to be from the  field of developmental psychology.
* Fund-raising for the Long Marine Laboratory (LML) Visitor  Education Center passed the halfway point with major support this  year from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation ($200,000); Paul  and Anne Irwin ($100,000 unitrust); the Moore Family Foundation  ($50,000); Robert Stephens and Julie Packard ($50,000); Frances B. McAllister ($25,000); the MLB Foundation ($15,000); Jeremy and  Patricia Lezin ($15,000); and the Friends of Long Marine Laboratory.  The planned $4.4 million facility will allow LML to expand its public  education program.
* The Santa Cruz Business and Professional Women's Club  (BPW) endowed a Leadership Opportunity Awards scholarship in the  club's name with a gift of $200,000. Funded with proceeds from the  sale of the group's clubhouse, the annual award was designated to  support a woman student.
* Biochemist Joseph Puglisi was one of twenty outstanding  young U.S. researchers to receive a 1994 fellowship from the David  and Lucile Packard Foundation. The prestigious award provides up to  $100,000 in research support annually for five years.
* A February 1995 performance of Dancetime! raised more than  $20,000 for UCSC's Leadership Opportunity Awards program. The  evening of theater, dance, and comedy, held at Cabrillo College, was  the first annual fund-raiser for the scholarship program, which  supports community college transfer students.
* UCSC sold property donated to the university more than 50  years ago (and an adjacent parcel purchased later) to benefit its  current and future students. Nearly $2.1 million will go to establish  the Adolph C. Miller and Mary Sprague Miller undergraduate  scholarship endowment, with $200,000 establishing two  fellowships for environmental studies graduate students in  remembrance of Newton B. Drury and Robert Gordon Sproul.
