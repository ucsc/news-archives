**Pam Lawson,** manager of the Literature Department, was named Woman of the Year for 1998 by the Scotts Valley Chamber of Commerce. She received the honor in recognition of her community service and outstanding contributions to the Scotts Valley School District.

Just before the Scotts Valley announcement, Lawson had received one of the UCSC Alumni Association's highest honors as outstanding staff member for 1998. The Alumni Association award recognized Lawson's 25 years of service and her unflagging commitment, good humor, competence, and tact.

As a parent of a child in the Scotts Valley School District for the past seven years, Lawson has worked in fund-raising, policy setting, and been an advocate for establishing a high school in Scotts Valley. She has served as a member of the Scotts Valley Educational Foundation (of which she is current president), the Vine Hill School site council, the Scotts Valley Middle School Parent Club (of which she is co-vice president), the Scotts Valley High School Education Specifications Committee, and is a founding member of Parents for Scotts Valley High School.

The **Women's and Men's Swimming and Diving Team,** led by first-year coach **Kim Musch,** turned in record-breaking performances at the Pacific Collegiate Swimming and Diving Conference Championships in Long Beach February 13-15. The women's team placed fifth out of 15 teams, which included many NCAA Division I and II schools. The Slugs swam one of their fastest meets ever, breaking 10 out of the 19 UCSC women's swimming records in the following events.
* **Jenny Koval:** 200 and 500 freestyle
* **Andrea Maglasang:** 200 butterfly, 200 back, and 400 individual medley
* **Lexa Dillon:** 1,650 freestyle
* **April Alexander:** 100 and 200 breaststroke
* **Magslang, Dillon, Keiko Nakai,** and **Koval:** 800 free relay
* **Maglasang, Alexander, Christine Caurant,** and **Koval:** 400 medley relay

The Slug women also had 19 NCAA National Championship qualifying "B" times.

The men's team finished seventh out of 10 schools. **Steve Worrell** broke the UCSC 200 breaststroke record, which had stood since the 1995-96 season. The men's team had four NCAA National Championship qualifying "B" times.

The Slugs are now looking ahead to the NCAA Division III championships, which will take place March 11-13 in Miami, Ohio.
