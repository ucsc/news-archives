SANTA CRUZ, CA--Dodie Bellamy and Kevin Killian, two prominent  San Francisco area poet/authors, will read from their works on  Thursday, November 30, at 4 p.m. at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, in the Cowell College Provost's House. The talk is free  and open to the public.

Bellamy is a leading figure in the "New Narrative" movement, a  group of writers combining aspects of prose, theory, and poetry in  their work. She is the author of Feminine Hijinx (New York: Hanuman  Books, 1990), Answer (Buffalo: Leave Books, 1992), and, with the  late Sam D'Allesandro, Real (Hoboken: Talisman House, 1994).  Bellamy curates a reading series at the San Francisco bookstore  Small Press Traffic, and, with Killian, co-edits the magazine  Mirage/Periodical.

Bellamy's work has been widely published in journals and  anthologies, including Writing, Bomb, Front, Poetics Journal, 6ix,  Zyzzyva, City Lights Review, High Risk, and The Art of Practice. She  is currently working on the "The Letters of Mina Harker," a novel that  brings the heroine of Bram Stoker's fin-de-siecle masterpiece  Dracula forward into the acronymic age of MTV, HIV, ATM, VCR.

Kevin Killian is a poet, novelist, critic, and playwright. He has  authored a number of works, including the novels Shy (Freedom,  Calif.: Crossing Press, 1989) and Bedrooms Have Windows (New York:  Amethyst Press, 1989), and two chapbooks, Desiree and Santa. His  work has been widely anthologized in such collections as Best  American Poetry 1988 (New York: Macmillan, 1988) and Wrestling  with the Angel: Faith and Religion in the Lives of Gay Men (New York:  Riverhead Books, 1995). He has written on the Bay Area art scene for  Artforum, Artweek, and Framework.

With Lew Ellingham, Killian is writing a biography of the  American poet Jack Spicer (1925-65). He is also working on a new  novel, titled "Spreadeagle," and a long poem about Italian horror  films and HIV in the U.S., called "Argento Series."

The talk is sponsored by The Living Writers Cluster of The  Center for Cultural Studies at UCSC. For more information, call  (408) 459-4899.
