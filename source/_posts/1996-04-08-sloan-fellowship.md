SANTA CRUZ, CA--Jonathan Weitsman, an associate professor of  mathematics at UC Santa Cruz, is one of 100 outstanding young  researchers who have received prestigious fellowships from the  Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the foundation announced Friday.  Weitsman will receive $35,000 per year for two years.

Weitsman studies a field of mathematics called symplectic  geometry. From the Greek symplegma, meaning complex, entangled,  or plaited together, symplectic geometry provides a unified and  coherent framework for many different physical phenomena. By  revealing underlying geometric structure where none appeared to  exist, symplectic geometry has become a powerful tool in optics,  astrophysics, electronics, and other fields. Many problems of  interest to Weitsman arise in the theory of Riemann surfaces--the  geometry of curved spaces in two dimensions--as well as in three-  and four-dimensional geometry and topology.

Weitsman joined the UCSC faculty in 1994. He has bachelor's  degrees in mathematics and physics from the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Harvard  University. He has held appointments at Harvard, MIT, UC Berkeley,  the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, the  Newton Institute in Cambridge, England, and Columbia University.

Since 1955, the Sloan Foundation has awarded more than $72  million dollars to about 3,100 researchers. Nineteen former Sloan  Fellows have received Nobel Prizes. The average age of the 1996  fellows is about 32 years. They were selected from more than 400  scientists in the early stages of their careers, based on their  exceptional promise to contribute to the advancement of knowledge.  Candidates are nominated by department chairs and other senior  scholars familiar with their talents.

Sloan scholars are free to pursue whatever lines of inquiry are  of most interest to them, and they are permitted to use fellowship  funds in a wide variety of ways to further their research aims. This  flexibility can be of great value to young scientists who are at a  pivotal stage in establishing their own independent research  projects.
