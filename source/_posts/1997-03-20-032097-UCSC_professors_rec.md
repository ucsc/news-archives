title: UC Santa Cruz Professors Receive Neh Funding For Their Plan To Create A New Approach To The "Classics"

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Classical, Medieval, and Renaissance studies are  traditionally taught as separate subjects--students in a Classics course are  likely to read Trojan Women, but usually won't learn about Italian  Renaissance painting or Medieval political systems without taking an art  history or history course. A group of scholars at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, want to change that tradition and examine these  seemingly distinct subjects in concert through an interdisciplinary  approach. Their project, Pre- and Early-Modern Studies (PEMS), is being  supported through funding from both the National Endowment for the  Humanities and UCSC.

"PEMS provides a broader perspective on cultures of the past, finding  interrelations not only between eras but between disciplines," explained  associate professor of art history Catherine Soussloff.

Soussloff and her two colleagues are working to establish an  interdisciplinary PEMS major at UCSC that entails collaboration between the  departments of art history, history, literature, politics, theater arts, and  women's studies. Their efforts are being supported by a $25,000 grant from  the NEH. Leading the NEH-funded project are Soussloff and associate  professor of classics Karen Bassi. Bassi is also codirector with assistant  professor of literature Margo Hendricks of a campus-funded Focused  Research Activity in PEMS.

The NEH grant supports a one-year faculty development project in  which UCSC faculty and visiting scholars will meet to discuss structuring  and teaching the major. Now at the mid-year point, faculty have presented  and attended seminars on topics in the areas of "Disciplines and Discourses"  and "Cultures in Contact." Seminars--a total of nine--continue through the  school year and will also address the topics of identity, gender, and  sexuality. The Focused Research Activity has sponsored several seminars  and lectures on PEMS-related topics.

Interdisciplinary majors--in which students are required to take  classes from more than one department--are a recent phenomenon, and the  PEMS major will be one of a handful at UCSC. Eighteen UCSC faculty from six  different departments are currently involved. Plans are to have the major  established by the 1998-99 academic year.

"This interdisciplinary approach opens so many doors," Hendricks  noted. "There are areas of study that still are just beginning to flourish in  academia, such as gender studies and cultural studies. Generally, such  approaches are more fully engaged with contemporary (i.e., 20th-century)  concerns. Through the PEMS major we want to train these new perspectives  onto other historical moments and see, for example, how women were  represented in the various media shaping pre- and Early-Modern cultures  (the text, art, and public records of 17th-century Florence for instance).  What you will discover is that the traditional portrait of history begins to  shift as you apply these new perspectives."  Bassi noted that the project is unusual not only because of its  interdisciplinary focus, but also because it supports collaboration and  instructional development. "Normally, faculty don't have enough time to talk  about the relationship between their research and their teaching. The NEH  seminars make it possible for us to engage in sustained and lively  discussions of that relationship as we plan the major in PEMS."
