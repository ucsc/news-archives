![\[Photo of New Teacher Center opening\]][1]Late last month, UCSC opened the New Teacher Center in downtown Santa Cruz to help schools develop high-quality, well-trained teachers. One of the first offerings at the center was a symposium on teacher induction. Participating in a "breakout session" during the symposium were (l-r) Nancy Lourie Markowitz, professor at San Jose State; Anna Ershler Richert, professor at Mills College; Joyce Justus, chair of the UCSC Education Department; and Pam Spycher, a local teacher.
