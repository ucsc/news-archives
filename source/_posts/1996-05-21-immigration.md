SANTA CRUZ, CA--Forget the Border Patrol. Forget Proposition 187.  Forget fences, and barbed wire, and high-speed chases. The debate  over immigration has become so distorted by anxiety over illegal  immigration that the rhetoric on both sides fails to capture the  complexity of what's at stake.

In a thoughtful new book titled The Immigration Debate:  Remaking America (West Hartford, CT: Kumarian Press, 1996),  economist John Isbister of the University of California, Santa Cruz,  presents the pros and cons of immigration. He covers the economic,  social, and cultural impacts of immigration--both legal and illegal.

Among the questions Isbister examines are:
* Does immigration contribute to the vitality of the American  economy?
* Is the quality of the immigrant labor force deteriorating?
* Are immigrants unusually enterprising?
* Does immigration take away jobs from Americans? Does it  reduce American wages?
* Does immigration contribute to the growing income gap  between the rich and the poor?
* Do immigrants present a fiscal burden for Americans, who  must pay for services such as education, health care, welfare, social  security, and criminal justice? Or do immigrants contribute their  share in taxes?
* Will immigration harm the environment and deplete natural  resources?
* Is this wave of immigration unusually large?
* Can the United States increase its cultural diversity  without increasing conflict?
* How should immigrant applicants be prioritized?
* Are American border controls morally justified?

Isbister's review of the academic literature on the economic  impact of immigration leads him to an unusual conclusion: "Half of  the economists say immigration is wonderful for the economy, and  the other half says it's terrible. I didn't find the academic literature  persuasive on either side," says Isbister, a proponent of  immigration. "For the most part, we don't know. The studies are  inconclusive, contradictory, and methodologically flawed in ways  that can't be fixed." Given that uncertainty, Isbister concludes that  the social benefits of a liberal immigration policy outweigh what  appears to be a slight risk of negative economic impacts.

"Certainly, much of the American economy depends on the work  of illegal immigrants--in agriculture, as motel maids, washing  dishes--all the lousy jobs employers don't want to pay minimum  wage for," says Isbister. "And employers know they won't get  complaints because illegal immigrants can't complain without fear  of being deported. In that sense, immigration is bad for African  Americans and low-skilled Americans who are displaced by  immigrants who will work for below minimum wage."

But Isbister argues that the national interest is much broader  than just economic and that multicultural relations are central to  American life. "The economic risks are countered by the positive  contributions immigrants make to the quality of American life,"  says Isbister. "Immigration is consistent with the moral values that  Americans hold dear."

Isbister says the border crackdown now under way may  actually increase the size of the undocumented population in the  United States by encouraging those who make it across the border to  stay. There are some 2 to 3 million illegal border crossings every  year, explains Isbister, but the number of undocumented  immigrants--including students, businesspeople, and tourists who  enter the country legally but overstay their visas--increases by only  about 300,000 a year. "Clearly, most of those who make it across go  back to Mexico--some go back and forth," says Isbister. Making it  more difficult to cross the border may encourage immigrants to stay  rather than face the greater risk of crossing repeatedly, he cautions.

"The only way to stop illegal immigration is to stop employers  from hiring undocumented immigrants," says Isbister. "You can't stop  it at the border."

Illegal immigration is like the drug war, says Isbister. "The  only way to stop the flow of drugs into this country is to stop the  demand," he says. "And it's the same with undocumented aliens. If  Americans want to hire them--and they do--the flow will not stop,  no matter how tight the laws are."

Isbister, who is himself an immigrant from Canada and whose  father served for a period as that country's deputy minister of  citizenship and immigration, says concern about illegal immigration  has spilled over to legal immigration: public opinion is running about  70 percent against immigration--both legal and illegal.

"There's a great deal of resistance in the United States to new  languages, new cultures, and new colors," says Isbister. "But I do  really believe there are great advantages of immigration to  Americans. This is a country of immigrants, and our greatest  achievement besides our wealth is that we've created a country of  people from different parts of the world who are able both to  maintain their identities and yet create a new whole, which is the  United States."
