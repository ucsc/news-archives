author: Barbara McKenna

SANTA CRUZ, CA--In an April talk on Victorian author Thomas  Carlyle at the University of California, Santa Cruz, cultural  historian Hayden White will discuss the view that history is not a  reflection of facts as much as a reflection of the person writing  about an event. In support of this theory, White will explore  Carlyle's approach to historical writing.

The talk, "Carlyle and the Historical Fantastic," is being  presented as the annual Norman and Charlotte Strouse Lecture on  Thomas Carlyle and His Era. It takes place at 4 p.m. on Friday, April  21, in McHenry Library Special Collections, third floor. The talk is  free and open to the public.

"What I mean by the historical fantastic is that the past is a  place into which we project all kinds of fantasies. The past is  interpreted differently by different generations and different  groups," White says. For example, Carlyle's historical writings were  highly respected in his day, but now, White says, "Carlyle is  typically treated as a kind of madman whose work is regarded as a  kind of enthusiast history in the romantic and sentimental mode. But  he used the same operation for writing history as any other  historian, it's just a different style."

A professor emeritus of history of consciousness, White is one  of sixteen faculty throughout the University of California system  selected as a University Professor. A fellow of the American  Academy of Arts and Sciences, White has also served as a fellow of  numerous other humanities organizations. He is author and editor of  several books, including a groundbreaking book in the field of history  of consciousness.

The Strouse lectures on Carlyle are given annually at UCSC to  complement the Norman and Charlotte Strouse Collection of Thomas  Carlyle, a rich holding of Carlyle's books, letters, manuscripts, and  other items, established in 1966 and housed in Special Collections  at the University Library.
