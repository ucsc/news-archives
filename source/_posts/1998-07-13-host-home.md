As the availability of housing in the Santa Cruz community becomes  increasingly scarce, UCSC's Community Rentals Program is requesting that  UCSC employees, through the Host Home Program, consider providing  temporary housing to students early in the fall quarter.

Chancellor Greenwood, in a June 13 [letter][2] to the campus community, outlined the expected housing need and the assistance members of the campus community can provide students by participating in the Host Home Program.
