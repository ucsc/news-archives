SANTA CRUZ, CA--George Von der Muhll, professor emeritus of  politics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been  awarded a Fulbright Lectureship for the coming academic year at  Charles University in Prague.

Von der Muhll will lecture on the principles of democracy,  democratic regimes and democratization, American politics and  society, and American political philosophy under the auspices of the  university's recently founded American Studies Program in the  Institute of International Studies.

One of the four oldest universities in Europe, Charles  University is undergoing major changes since the collapse of the  Communist government in late 1989. Von der Muhll has had previous  experience with curricular planning in times of rapid political  change as a Fulbright Lecturer at Makerere University in Uganda and  at Haile Selassie I University in Ethiopia. He will draw on these  experiences, as well as his work promoting general education  courses at UCSC while he was chair of the Educational Policy  Committee, in his work in the Czech Republic. His goal is to  contribute to the institutionalization of professional political  science at the university.

Von der Muhll will be accompanied by his wife, Lydia  Blanchard, a mental health professional who is eager to use her  background in family therapy and crisis intervention in a society  newly open to contemporary Western therapeutic practices.

The Fulbright Program is an international educational exchange  program administered by the United States government. Grants are  awarded to U.S. students, teachers, and scholars to study, teach,  lecture, and conduct research abroad. Grants are also given to  foreign nationals to engage in similar activities in the United  States. The program was established in 1946 to increase mutual  understanding between the people of the United States and the  people of other countries. Approximately 4,800 new grants are  awarded annually.
