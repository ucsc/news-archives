## Hummingbird Day comes to Arboretum March 13

By [Stephen McCabe

Hummingbirds whiz by, darting in and out, some chasing others away from favorite bushes. Displaying males climb high in the air, pause, and then plummet towards earth, pulling up at the last split second accompanied by a loud peep!

A new Hummingbird Trail Map practically guarantees you will see all of this type of behavior at the UCSC Arboretum on Hummingbird Day. The event takes place Saturday, March 13, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The hummingbirds are out in sun, fog, or even a light rain. There is more activity this month, when some of the migratory hummers join the resident Anna's Hummingbirds, and males are trying to impress the females.

Programs for children and adults start at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., with tours of the plants that attract hummingbirds at 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. The program for adults is led by Jeff Davis, UCSC curator of the Natural History Collection, and David Suddjian, president of the local bird club. It includes slide shows and a tour.

Suddjian says the Arboretum is the best place in California to see Allen's Hummingbirds. Davis is working with the Arboretum staff and UCSC students to post educational signs about hummingbirds in the garden. Lists of plants that attract hummingbirds will be available on Hummingbird Day.

The Arboretum is located off of High St. between the East and West entrances to the UCSC campus. Regular hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day.
