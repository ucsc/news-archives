SANTA CRUZ, CA--Geneticist Mary-Claire King, one of the country's  most prominent breast-cancer researchers, will discuss the latest  research on genetic predispositions toward cancer in a public  lecture next week at UC Santa Cruz. King's talk, titled "Genetic  Analysis of Breast and Ovarian Cancer," begins at 7 p.m. on Friday,  September 19, at the new Music Center Recital Hall. Admission is  free.

UCSC is sponsoring the lecture in conjunction with the  American Cancer Society, which will hold a national meeting on  cancer research from September 18 through 21 at the Chaminade  Conference Center. The meeting, the first Schilling Research  Conference, is funded through a $1.6 million legacy to the American  Cancer Society by the late Col. Frank K. Schilling of Santa Cruz. Col.  Schilling's wife, Else H. "Henny" Schilling, succumbed to breast  cancer in 1985.

King will attempt to describe the impacts of current breast- cancer research on the lives of women. Many women's magazines  today contain articles about breast cancer, often with descriptions  of genetic research and gene testing. However, this flurry of  findings can perplex all but the most dedicated followers of the  subject.

An experienced public speaker, King will place this research  into an everyday context for the audience. She also will answer  questions following her talk.

King is the Walt Disney-American Cancer Society Research  Professor for Breast Cancer and a professor of medical genetics at  the University of Washington. She gained renown in 1990 for leading  a team of scientists that discovered the location of the gene called  BRCA1. The researchers believe that defects in this gene, passed  from one generation to the next, cause roughly 10 percent of all  cases of breast cancer. The gene also appears to play a role in some  ovarian cancers.

King began her search for the BRCA1 gene in 1974, at a time  when most of the scientific community did not believe breast cancer  could be hereditary. She was driven by a conviction that breast  cancer cannot be prevented, but can be controlled. Her discovery has  opened a new approach to the prevention, control, and treatment of  breast cancer.

King's current projects include research with seven major  cancer centers in New York City to identify the role of inherited  susceptibility to breast cancer among Jewish women, and with the  University of North Carolina to ask the same questions among rural  southern African-American and Caucasian women. King's team also  is investigating the interaction of inherited susceptibility and  environmental risk factors among 120,000 participants in the  Harvard Nurses' Health Study.

In other research, King's group is testing whether tamoxifen  reduces risk for breast cancer among women with inherited  susceptibility. Finally, King and collaborators from Vanderbilt  University have begun a clinical trial to test gene therapy as  treatment for ovarian cancer.

The American Cancer Society is the largest nationwide  voluntary health organization dedicated to eliminating cancer as a  major health problem. The society focuses on preventing cancer,  saving lives from cancer, and diminishing suffering from cancer  through research, education, advocacy, and service.
