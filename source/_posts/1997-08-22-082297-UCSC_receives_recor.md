## UC Santa Cruz Receives $13.5 Million In Private Gifts For  Record-breaking Year

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California, Santa Cruz, received  more than $13.5 million in private support in the form of gifts and  grants during the fiscal year that ended June 30--the highest total  recorded in UCSC's 32-year history, according to the campus's  Development Office.

The total was more than double that received by the university  in the previous year, when $6.1 million was contributed to campus  programs, scholarships, and fellowships. The previous fund-raising  record of $9.3 million was set in 1994-95.

This year's total included a $5-million gift from philanthropist  and UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee Jack Baskin. Baskin's gift, by  far the largest in campus history, helped launch UCSC's first  professional school, the Jack Baskin School of Engineering.

"Alumni, parents, friends of the university, corporations,  foundations, and others demonstrated tremendous support for UC  Santa Cruz this year through their giving," said Daniel G. Aldrich III,  assistant chancellor for University Advancement. "Our extraordinary  gift for the Baskin Engineering School capped an outstanding year of  private support."

New records were set by a number of UCSC's fund-raising  programs. Annual Fund contributions--primarily consisting of annual  gifts from alumni and parents and matching funds from  corporations--totaled nearly $1.1 million, a 22 percent increase  over the previous year. The Telephone Outreach Program raised  $810,607, an increase of 34 percent over last year's total, and  parent donors contributed nearly $675,000, 61 percent more than  last year.

The bulk of the funding came from the following sources:  individuals other than alumni and parents, 55 percent; foundations,  14 percent; the business sector, 14 percent; and alumni and parents,  10 percent. Other sources included trusts and bequests and campus  and community organizations.

"We are grateful to a lot of people, including our Foundation  trustees and UCSC faculty and staff, for their efforts on the  university's behalf in generating private gifts and grants this year,"  Aldrich said. "Private support will become even more important as  we grow as a campus. It's at the core of our ability to provide access  to a quality education for all of California's qualified citizens."

Major private gifts or grants received by UCSC during the past  year included:

\-- A gift of $250,000 from Narpat and Chandra Bhandari of Los  Gatos, which established the Chandra Bhandari Chair in India  Studies. The endowment will support an interdisciplinary approach  to studying historical and modern Indian cultures both on the  subcontinent and around the world.

\-- A preliminary distribution of $207,000 from the estate of  UCSC Professor Emeritus Siegfried "Sig" Puknat, which will  establish the Siegfried B. and Elisabeth Mignon Puknat Music  Endowment and support UCSC's Literary Studies Endowment. Puknat  died in March of this year.

\-- A gift of $100,000 from David S. Lee, chairman of CMC  industries in Santa Clara and a member of the UC Board of Regents.  Lee's gift established an endowed scholarship fund for the Jack  Baskin School of Engineering. Two of Lee's three children are UCSC  graduates.

\-- A contribution of computer equipment valued at more than  $300,000 to the school of engineering from Digital Equipment  Corporation (DEC). The equipment will greatly expand the capacity of  UCSC's cutting-edge research in computational biology. The work is  an important part of the Human Genome Project, an international  effort to map human genetic makeup.

\-- A donation of more than $35,000 from UCSC's class of '77-- the largest gift ever made by an alumni class--to the UCSC Alumni  Association Scholarship Fund.

\-- A pledge of more than $300,000 to the UCSC Arboretum  from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. The funds will provide  general operating support for the Arboretum over the next three  years, including support for the development of long-range financial  and fund-raising plans for the Arboretum's world-renowned  horticultural collection.

\-- A significant augmentation of the Paul and Anne Irwin  Unitrust, which will ultimately benefit the Joseph M. Long Marine  Laboratory.

\-- The creation of the John and Layne Halliday Unitrust, which  will ultimately help support the marine laboratory, the Alfred E.  Heller Endowed Chair in Agroecology, and the Astronomy and  Astrophysics Department.

In addition, UCSC physicist Sue Carter received a David and  Lucile Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering, worth  $500,000 over five years. She is the third UCSC faculty member to  receive the award: Biochemist Joseph Puglisi and molecular  biologist Charles Wilson accepted awards in 1994 and 1995,  respectively.
