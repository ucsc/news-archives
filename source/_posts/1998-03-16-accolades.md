Professor **Stanley Flatté** was recently made a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS). His citation reads "For work on meson spectroscopy and for work on wave propagation in random media with innovative contributions to ocean acoustics, atmospheric optics, seismology, and numerical simulation." Each year only one APS member in 200 is made a Fellow, and Professor Flatté's honor is all the more significant because his fellowship is not associated with one of the specialty divisions of the society. He was chosen as one of a very small number of "At Large" Fellows because his work has spanned a wide variety of disciplines within the natural sciences.
