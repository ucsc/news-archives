SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California, Santa Cruz, has  received gifts totaling $500,000 from two private foundations  toward the construction of an Education Center at the Joseph M. Long  Marine Laboratory. The Wayne and Gladys Valley Foundation of  Oakland donated $300,000 for the project, while the J. M. Long  Foundation of Walnut Creek provided $200,000.

To date, donors and foundations have committed about $1.9  million to the center, which will dramatically enhance the lab's  education programs for schoolchildren and the general public.  Project planners estimate that the 12,000-square-foot facility will  cost $4.4 million for construction and exhibitions. Aside from  $500,000 in state money for a teaching lab in part of the new  complex, private support will provide most of the funds.

"Gifts such as those from the Valley Foundation and the J. M.  Long Foundation are crucial to the successful completion of this  important project," says Daniel Aldrich, assistant chancellor for  University Advancement at UCSC. "We appreciate their investment in  the university's education programs at a time when public  understanding of marine research is vital to global well-being."

The Valley Foundation was created by the late F. Wayne Valley  and Gladys Valley to provide grants for education, medical research,  and community and social services, primarily to universities and  agencies in the east San Francisco Bay Area. F. Wayne Valley was  founder and major owner of Citation Builders of San Leandro and was  an initial general partner of the Oakland Raiders.

The J. M. Long Foundation was established by the late Joseph M.  Long, cofounder and past chairman of the board of Longs Drug Stores  and a major benefactor of both UCSC and the Long Marine Lab, which  bears his name. The foundation benefits organizations in the western  U.S. involved with health care, medical research, education, wildlife  conservation, and land preservation.

A conceptual design for the Education Center calls for  interactive exhibits with changeable components for various age  groups, a teaching lab for university classes and programs for local  schools, a bookstore and gift shop, staff offices, outdoor viewing  areas, a courtyard containing the lab's skeleton of a blue whale, and  a 100-seat auditorium. Work could begin as early as next summer;  construction would last about fifteen months.

The center will fill the need for a permanent home for Long  Marine Lab's public activities. Since it opened in 1978, the lab has  housed many of the scientific programs of UCSC's Institute of Marine  Sciences. Unlike other research facilities, however, Long Marine Lab  also plays a key role in teaching visitors about the Monterey Bay  environment. Up to 40,000 people visit the lab each year, including  schoolchildren whose trips are arranged months in advance. More  than 130 volunteers and docents lead tours and demonstrations for  these groups.

Because of the lab's limited space and staffing, many school  groups cannot visit each year. Educational programs occur in a  trailer, while the lab's museum, aquarium, and touch tanks occupy  other small areas. In addition, the general public may visit the lab  for just three hours each day. The new center promises to change all  that.

"We've expanded our public programs in recent years, but our  facilities haven't kept pace," says Gary Griggs, director of the  Institute of Marine Sciences. "The Education Center represents a  chance for us to build a first-class program by bringing in more  people and events and showing more effectively how research is  carried out."

Dorris Welch-Burman, the lab's public education director,  estimates that at least four times as many schoolchildren will use  the new center. Exhibits will give hands-on information about  marine animals, conservation, and careers in marine science to  students in primary, intermediate, middle, and high schools. Touch  tanks, "discovery labs" with microscopes and magnified pools,  skeletons and fossils, and interactive panels will provide students a  feel for marine-lab research. The building's design, Welch-Burman  notes, will foster this experience: It will not be a formal aquarium,  but rather a more rough-hewn and natural extension of the sights,  sounds, and smells of the lab itself.

Public visiting hours will expand to seven hours a day, with  both self-guided and docent tours available. A multimedia exhibit  with a computer and laserdisc system will let guests explore  various aspects of lab research at their own pace. New bilingual  signs and exhibits will make the lab more open to Spanish-speaking  visitors. Finally, the auditorium will provide space for large groups  and will allow the lab's popular summer lecture series to occur  throughout the year.

The center's exact location depends upon the resolution of the  Terrace Point Properties project next to Long Marine Lab, currently  under review. If a satisfactory project is approved, Wells Fargo Bank  has indicated a willingness to donate about twelve acres of land to  UCSC for open space, the Education Center, and a building for the  Branch of Pacific Marine Geology of the U.S. Geological Survey. The  Education Center would sit back from the coastal bluff and provide  dramatic ocean views from two decks. Without this land, Long  Marine Lab would expand more tightly on its existing property; the  center would overlook the adjoining Younger Lagoon Natural Reserve.

SRG Partnership, an architect/design group from Portland,  Oregon, will design the Education Center with BIOS, an exhibit  design group from Seattle. This team collaborated on the Oregon  Coast Aquarium in Newport, the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology in  Charleston, and Washington's striking Mount St. Helens Visitors  Center.
