TORONTO, ONTARIO--Many quasars, the most luminous objects in the  universe, are swaddled by galaxies containing ordinary stars that lie  at the same distances from earth as the quasars themselves,  according to a new study that used the Keck I and Keck II Telescopes  in Hawaii.

The observations also provide tantalizing evidence that galaxy  collisions fuel the prodigious energy outputs of at least some  quasars, presumably by hurling fresh stellar debris into the gorges  of gigantic black holes at the cores of the galaxies.

Astronomers at UC Observatories/Lick Observatory, UC Santa  Cruz, took the first detailed spectra of the nebulous blobs that lurk  faintly around most quasars found to date. The spectra, which reveal  the compositions and distances of light-emitting objects, clearly  point to galaxies full of normal stars around the quasars. Features in  the spectra indicate that the stars are mature, with ages of at least  1 billion to perhaps 10 billion years.

Most astronomers believed that quasars reside within typical  galaxies, not alone or bathed in some unusual nonstellar material.  Indeed, recent images from the Hubble Space Telescope revealed  numerous quasars shining forth from blobs resembling galaxies.  However, researchers needed spectra to confirm that the objects  were galaxies, and that the galaxies and quasars were the same  distances from earth. Keck's light-gathering power made that  analysis possible.

"The evidence is extraordinarily strong that quasars live in  host galaxies, just as we expected," says Joseph Miller, leader of the  observing team and director of UCO/Lick Observatory. "This is  consistent with the hypothesis that quasars are natural features of  massive galaxies. They are direct consequences of how galaxies  evolve, not strange aberrations or freaks of nature."

The spectra of a few "companion" blobs close to the host  galaxies show that the companions also are populations of stars at  the same distances. These stars most likely form the cores of  galaxies in the throes of being gravitationally rent by collisions,  Miller says.

"Our spectra suggest that galaxy merging has taken place," he  says. "Like throwing gasoline onto a fire, this process may make  quasars burst forth with new energy by transferring mass into the  centers of the host galaxies. Quasars may turn on and off or change  their appearances depending on how each merger evolves." Miller presented his research today (Monday, January 13) in  Toronto at the 189th meeting of the American Astronomical Society.  His coworkers were former UC Santa Cruz graduate student Hien  Tran, now a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National  Laboratory, and current graduate student Andrew Sheinis.

Miller's team conducted its study on the Keck I Telescope in  August 1996 and on the Keck II Telescope in December 1996. In both  cases, they used the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS),  designed by astronomers at Caltech. They examined spectra of the  nebulosities around ten quasars, with an average exposure time of  about two hours for each spectrum.

The quasars in the study, says Miller, are among the closest  and brightest quasars in the sky. Their redshifts--a measure of how  quickly they are receding--vary from 15 to 30 percent of the speed  of light (z = .15 to .35). This corresponds roughly to a distance of  between 1.5 and 3 billion light-years from earth. Miller's group plans  to expand its study to include both a larger sample of "nearby"  quasars and ones that have larger redshifts. Such research may  allow the team to unveil relationships between the natures of the  quasars and the galaxies in which they dwell.

When they displayed their recent Hubble Space Telescope  images of quasars, astronomers led by John Bahcall of the Institute  for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., and Mike Disney of the  University of Wales said that many of the purported host galaxies  appeared to be in the midst of collisions or to have suffered recent  violence. Others, however, looked quiescent. Some weak quasars,  Miller notes, may get their fuel from the mass shed by normal stars  as they evolve. "Bars" and instabilities in the structures of some  galaxies also may propel material toward their cores, but that  process is poorly understood.

The W. M. Keck Observatory, a partnership of the University of  California, Caltech, and NASA, is located at the summit of the  dormant Mauna Kea volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii. Its twin  400-inch telescopes, Keck I and Keck II, began routine observations  in November 1993 and October 1996, respectively. The W. M. Keck  Foundation of Los Angeles granted more than $130 million toward  Keck I and Keck II--about 80 percent of the total construction costs.

UC Observatories/Lick Observatory, headquartered at UC Santa  Cruz, oversees both the Lick Observatory east of San Jose,  California, and the UC share of the Keck Observatory.
