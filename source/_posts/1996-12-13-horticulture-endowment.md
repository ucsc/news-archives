SANTA CRUZ, CA--Two sons plotted a self-described conspiracy having to do  with their mother and before they were done they had inveigled respectable  members of the local community, top campus administrators, and three  former chancellors to join in the scheme.

The sons, Mark Engel of Santa Cruz and Charlie Engel of Beverly Hills,  plotted to surprise their mother, Ruth, by establishing a library endowment  in her honor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The endowment was  announced on Friday, December 13, at the annual Dickens holiday gathering at  the McHenry Library.

Friends, family, and colleagues came to the event to honor Mrs. Engel.  Among the attendees were Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood and former UCSC  chancellors Dean McHenry, Robert Sinsheimer, and Karl Pister.

Before the scheduled events took place, Mrs. Engel listened in surprise  as her sons announced the establishment of the Ruth Franklin Engel  Horticulture Collection. The collection was established through the library's  subject endowment program. Library subject endowments, created with a  contribution of $10,000 or more, are an important means of expanding the  library collection. The private funds provide a source of ongoing support for  acquisitions in a specific area of interest. A special bookplate designed with  beautiful hand-drawn rose will bear the endowment name on all books  purchased through this fund.

"Mom has always been utterly opposed to such flagrantly un-anonymous  donations," Mark Engel observed before the ceremony. But her sons proceeded  anyway, eager to acknowledge Mrs. Engel's dedication as a longtime UCSC  volunteer. The sons chose horticulture for the library endowment, tying  together Mrs. Engel's twin interests of gardening and the library.

Both Mrs. Engel and her son Mark are members of the Friends of the  UCSC Library. Before resigning earlier this year, Mrs. Engel had served as  chair of the Friends' Membership Committee for more than a decade.  Additionally, she is an active member of the Garden Club of the UCSC  Women's Club, a member and former board member of the Friends of the  UCSC Farm and Garden, and a member of the Friends of the UCSC Arboretum.

"It's a real pleasure to see Ruth receive this well-deserved  recognition," said University Librarian Allan Dyson. "Ruth is a devoted  volunteer who has served the Friends of the UCSC Library in one capacity or  another for more years than either she or I would care to remember."

Additional donations to the Ruth Franklin Engel Horticulture Collection  may be made to the UCSC Foundation, UC Santa Cruz, Carriage House, Santa  Cruz, CA, 95064.
