SANTA CRUZ--An exhibit of the work of twelve art scholarship  recipients takes place this month at the University of California,  Santa Cruz. The twelve UCSC students, recipients of the 1994-95  William Hyde Irwin and Susan Benteen Irwin Scholarships, will  exhibit their work May 17 through June 12 in Porter College's J. B.  Hall Gallery, with an opening reception on Wednesday, May 17, from  4 to 6 p.m.

Given annually to promising young artists, the Irwin  scholarship fund was established in 1986 through a gift from Mrs.  Irwin in memory of her late husband, an artist and writer. When she  died in 1990 the endowment totaled $500,000, which provides  $2,500 scholarships annually to up to thirteen students in visual  arts. Scholarships are awarded on the basis of merit and need.

This year's recipients are Yasser Aggour, Gina Borg, Holden  Chemers, Fritz Chesnut, Kathleen Connolly, Brian Ford, Barbara  Goodwin, My Quang Haba, Krisztina Ligeti, Oliver Mateo, Jose Solano,  and Heather Thompson.

The J. B. Hall Gallery is open Thursday through Sunday from 1  to 5 p.m. For gallery information, call (408) 459-2857.
