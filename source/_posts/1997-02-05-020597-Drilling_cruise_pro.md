SANTA CRUZ, CA--A floating team of scientists poking into the  Pacific Ocean floor off Costa Rica has unearthed mud that raises  puzzling questions about what fuels the volcanoes 125 miles away  on shore.

Researchers aboard Leg 170 of the Ocean Drilling Program  explored the origins of Central American volcanoes and other  geological mysteries during a two-month expedition from October to  December. The international team was led by Eli Silver, a geologist  at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Gaku Kimura of the  University of Osaka in Japan.

A patchwork of cooled plates of rock is all that separates the  oceans from the earth's hot upper mantle. But molten material  constantly seeps out of ridges between the plates, hardening and  adding to the plates as they drift apart. Only after creeping for eons  and accumulating marine sediments does each section of oceanic  plate sink--or "subduct"--back into the underlying stew.

The Cocos plate dives under Central America, carrying into the  Middle America Trench more than a thousand feet of clay and organic  slime. This cold, gray ocean mush, scientists believe, is converted  into red-hot magma 80 miles below the surface. The less-dense  magma then rises, violently breaching the surface through volcanoes.  Several active volcanoes, some of them quite dangerous, dot the  Costa Rican landscape.

Scientists have used a telltale radioactive element, beryllium-10, to clock the mush-to-magma recycling process. A  natural product of the atmosphere, beryllium-10 settles in high  concentrations on the seafloor and immediately begins decaying. In a  process similar to carbon dating, geologists can determine the age  of the resulting lava.

Volcanoes in neighboring Nicaragua have more beryllium-10  than anywhere else, researchers have found. But the element is  conspicuously absent from Costa Rica's lava. One explanation for the  difference is that Costa Rican magma spends 1.5 million more years  underground. Another possibility is that several hundred feet of  beryllium-rich ocean silt is scraped off by the jutting toe of the  continent. Earlier studies predicted that the top 250 feet of the  incoming 1,300 feet of sediment piled up on the seafloor.

To test these hypotheses, the team drilled holes up to a third  of a mile deep, piercing the edge of the Caribbean plate to reach the  subducting Cocos plate. Using a new tool, the researchers sampled  the physical and chemical properties of the plates at five different  sites.

Silver was surprised by what they found. "Essentially, almost  everything goes down," he says, except for the uppermost 15 to 30  feet of sediment. This material remains basically unchanged as it  slides under the overriding plate, compressing only slightly. "It's  really mind boggling," says Silver, that sediments made of 75 percent water can subduct without being deformed. "You'd think  it's just fluff."

The crew returned with many unanswered questions, but with  mounds of data to analyze. One thing Silver and his colleagues will  soon know is whether the ocean sludge off Costa Rica contains as  much beryllium as it does off Nicaragua. If this is true, they will  have to rethink their theories of how the sediments are recycled  into volcanic lava.
