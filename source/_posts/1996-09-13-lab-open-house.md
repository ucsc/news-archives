SANTA CRUZ, CA--The magic and mysteries of Monterey Bay are the  backdrops for one of the most popular family events in Santa Cruz: Long  Marine Laboratory's annual open house, set for Sunday, October 13. This  year's open house, the seventeenth, will feature activities for marine  enthusiasts of all ages, from adults who enjoy science talks to kids who  want to touch squirmy or spiny sea creatures.

About 2,500 people attended the open house last year at the lab,  perched atop a coastal bluff at the western edge of Santa Cruz. Admission is  free to the event, which runs from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Parking is available at  Silicon Systems, 2300 Delaware Avenue. Shuttle buses will transport people  to the lab.

Long Marine Lab, a marine-research facility operated by UC Santa Cruz,  opened in 1978. Its scientists work to understand Monterey Bay's unique  environment and explore other issues in the marine sciences worldwide. The  lab's education programs for schoolchildren and the general public draw  about 40,000 visitors annually.

Highlights of the open house include the following:
* Viewing of the lab's marine mammals, including dolphins and sea  lions.
* Talks, videos, and slide shows by researchers at UCSC's Institute of  Marine Sciences.
* Open research labs with microscopes, marine invertebrates, and  other critters.
* A "children's corner," touch tanks, and many other marine-oriented  activities for kids.
* Live jazz music by Crosswinds.
* Foods from local restaurants, including Carniglia's Seafood, El  Palomar, and Upper Crust Pizza & Pasta.

The event is accessible to those with disabilities; people needing  special arrangements should call the lab in advance.
