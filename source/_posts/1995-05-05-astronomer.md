SANTA CRUZ, CA--Steven Vogt, a professor of astronomy and  astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and an  astronomer at UCO/Lick Observatory, has received the Maria and Eric  Muhlmann Award for 1995 from the Astronomical Society of the  Pacific.

The award honors major results in astronomy made possible by  innovative advances in instrumentation. In Vogt's case, the society  recognized his work on the high-resolution echelle spectrograph  (HIRES), a primary observing tool at the W. M. Keck Observatory in  Hawaii. An eight-ton instrument the size of a living room, HIRES is  the most complex such instrument in the world and has led to  dramatic new findings in astronomy within the last year.

HIRES contains huge optical gratings, lenses, and mirrors  which break up the light from distant stars and galaxies into its  component colors, or spectrum, then focus it precisely on a  sensitive detector. The spectrograph works in conjunction with the  light-gathering power of the 400-inch Keck Telescope, the world's  largest optical telescope, to open new vistas upon the universe for  scientists. For instance, Vogt and other astronomers have used  HIRES to find evidence of "dark matter" in a satellite galaxy of our  Milky Way, take the temperature of the early universe, and measure  the types of atoms in extremely distant clouds of gas.

"This is truly a magnificent advance in astronomical  instrumentation," concluded the society's awards committee. Vogt  will receive a cash prize of $500 plus travel expenses to a June  meeting of the society at the University of Maryland, where he will  be honored.

Vogt joined the UCSC faculty in 1978. He led the design team  for HIRES and supervised its construction at the UCO/Lick  Observatory instrument shops at UCSC. The device was completed in  April 1993 and began its first routine scientific observations in  Hawaii in November 1993.

The Astronomical Society of the Pacific is the oldest national  astronomy group and the main U.S. organization dedicated to  astronomy education. It was established in 1889 by the first  director of Lick Observatory and an Oakland schoolteacher. Today, its  nearly 7,000 members--hailing from all 50 states and about 70  other countries--include astronomers, teachers, and people from all  walks of life who are interested in astronomy.
