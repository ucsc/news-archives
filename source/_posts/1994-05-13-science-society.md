SANTA CRUZ, CA--Chancellor Karl S. Pister of the University of  California, Santa Cruz, will speak on "Society, Technology, and  Science: For Whom and For What Purpose?" in a free public lecture on  Tuesday, May 31. Pister's talk begins at 7:30 p.m. in Thimann Lecture  Hall 3 on the UCSC campus.

Among the topics Pister will address are national standards  for science education and the interface between scientists and the  public. Pister is well positioned to consider these issues: He is  chair-elect of the Section on Engineering of the American  Association for the Advancement of Science, the country's largest  scientific organization. He also is a member of the National Academy  of Engineering and was recently elected to the prestigious American  Academy of Arts and Sciences.

The lecture is part of a series sponsored by Sigma Xi, an honor  society of scientists founded in 1886. Its goals are to encourage  appreciation and support of original work in science and technology  and to foster creative and dynamic interactions between researchers  and society. UCSC is home to a club of Sigma Xi, which will initiate  new members at its annual banquet on May 20.
