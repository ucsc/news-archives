## Top Educators To Visit Unique Summer School That Links Science Learning And English Language Development

What: Top educators from across the state will be visiting a unique summer school program in Salinas that combines science education and English language development. Visitors who are interested in replicating this successful program will observe students engaged in garden-based science projects and teachers using science to help students learn English.

When: Through July 25, 2000

Where: Frank Paul Elementary School  
1300 Rider Avenue Salinas, CA (831) 753-5740

Who: Reporters will have an opportunity to interview students in the Alisal School District, as well as teachers from the Aromas-San Juan, Hollister, North Monterey, Pajaro, and Salinas School Districts. Interviews in Spanish and English can be arranged.

Why: The University of California has been charged by Governor Gray Davis to increase professional development opportunities for teachers and to improve outreach to students with limited English proficiency.

Background: The Language Acquisition in Science Education in Rural Schools, or LASERS, project, uses science to help develop literacy in children with limited English skills in grades K-8. LASERS is a collaboration among the UC Santa Cruz Education Department, six school districts in central California, and the Life Lab Science Program. Now in its fifth year, the program has been successful with students and teachers and has gained the attention of the state's top educators, many of whom will visit the LASERS Summer School Academy this summer. UCSC researchers report that participating students make significant progress in their understanding of science content and show significant gains in language proficiency. For teachers, the summer session offers daily teaching opportunities combined with intensive peer coaching and feedback. Year-round activities further help teachers improve their instructional practices and integrate the teaching of science and English. Funded for five years by the National Science Foundation, LASERS will continue next year with the support of the Monterey Bay Science Project.
