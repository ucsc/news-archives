The Northern California Association of Phi Beta Kappa has given an Excellence in Teaching Award to **Quentin Williams,** professor of earth sciences. Williams, who played a major role in revising and redesigning the undergraduate curriculum in earth sciences, will receive a certificate and an honorarium of $500. The association gives three or four teaching awards annually to outstanding faculty members from among seven northern California universities and colleges with Phi Beta Kappa chapters. The 1999 awards will be presented May 15 at the association's annual meeting.

The Cancer Research Fund of the Damon Runyon-Walter Winchell Foundation has awarded a Runyon-Winchell postdoctoral fellowship to **Jennifer Armstrong.** The three-year fellowship will support Armstrong's research in the laboratory of **John Tamkun,** associate professor of biology. This prestigious award is given to outstanding young scientists conducting theoretical and experimental research that is relevant to the study of cancer and the search for cancer causes, mechanisms, therapies, and prevention. Armstrong's research involves genetic analysis of factors that regulate genes and control the fates of cells in Drosophila fruit flies.

**Gillian Greensite,** director of the Rape Prevention Education Program on campus, is one of eight individuals and two groups honored this year by the Santa Cruz County Women's Commission for their contributions to the community in improving the status of women. Greensite's contributions include not only the educational workshops and forums, self-defense classes, and individual counseling services she has provided students, staff, and faculty on campus for nearly two decades, but also her work off campus with high school and community college students and law-enforcement personnel. Greensite was also a cofounder of the Santa Cruz City Commission for the Prevention of Violence Against Women and served as its chairperson for six years. The Women's Commission presented the awards at a celebration on March 26 at the Pacific Cultural Center.
