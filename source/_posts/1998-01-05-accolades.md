A book by economics professor **Alan Richards** and coauthor John Waterbury, titled _A Political Economy of the Middle East,_ has been selected as an Outstanding Academic Book in 1997 by _Choice,_ a publication of the Association of College and Research Libraries. _Choice_ provides current reviews for academic libraries, and its outstanding book lists serve as an acquisition guide for academic librarians. The criteria used for inclusion on this prestigious list are excellence in scholarship and presentation, significance with regard to other literature in the field, and recognition as an important, often the first, treatment of a specific subject in print or electronic format.
