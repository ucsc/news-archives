title: Enjoy Strawberry Shortcake At The UCSC Farm On May 19

Six-year-old Chloe Hunt and her sister Hailey, 3, love the UCSC Farm. As members of the Farm's community supported agriculture (CSA) project, they visit the Farm at least twice a week during the growing season--once to pick up their box of freshly harvested vegetables and fruits, and once or twice more just for fun.

"I love everything," said Chloe. "I love the flowers and the strawberries. And the basil!"

The Farm is hosting its annual Strawberry Shortcake Festival on Wednesday, May 19, from 4 to 6 p.m. Live bluegrass music will add to the festivities as visitors enjoy fresh strawberry shortcake and tour the Farm. A $3 donation is requested.

The event is an opportunity for visitors to learn about the Farm, hear about the CSA, and enjoy the Farm's bucolic atmosphere. Members of the CSA receive a weekly supply of fresh-picked organic produce in exchange for purchasing a "share" in the Farm, a 25-acre organic farm that is managed by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. It's an arrangement that provides the Farm with guaranteed income while reconnecting members with the land.

Another fan of the Farm is Chancellor Greenwood, who has sponsored a low-income share in the CSA to provide a local family with organically grown food from June through October. "I don't have time to cook much, but this is a way for me to support the Farm's activities, and I encourage others to do the same," said Greenwood.

Jackie Hunt, mother of Chloe and Hailey and a graduate student in education at UCSC, says her family discovered the Farm three years ago when Hailey was just a babe in arms. As a former teacher, it was important to Hunt that her children understand where their food comes from.

"Visiting the Farm is a great way to enjoy the beauty of nature and to learn about science," she said. "There's always something to learn, to cut, to pick, or to smell."

The Hunts have a greater understanding of what fresh is now, and they have also expanded their culinary repertoire. "You find things in your box that you might not pick at the store, like kale," said Hunt. "They gave it to us with a recipe, and we found out that we love kale."

Full memberships cost $500 for the five-month growing season, or about $23 per week (a limited number of low-income shares, which are supported in part by donations collected at the Strawberry Shortcake Festival, are available). Quarterly payment plans are available.

Being a CSA member is economical, but it also opens new doors, said Hunt. Members are encouraged to pick flowers and herbs from the CSA garden when they pick up their box each week. "The value includes not just the vegetables, but flowers and herbs that you can pick yourself, and the chance to see the cycle of growth," said Hunt. "It's a learning process. It's a healthy thing and a beautiful thing."
