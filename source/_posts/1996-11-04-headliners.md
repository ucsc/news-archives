During a recent visit to Roosevelt High School in Fresno, **Chancellor Greenwood** was interviewed about the Web sites Student Affairs has developed for prospective students. She also described UCSC's expanding engineering program to reporters from the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel,_ KSCO-Radio, KSBW-TV, and KCCN-TV.  

**Manuel Pastor** of Latin American and Latino studies praised a new study by the Public Policy Institute of California about trends in illegal immigration. The _Riverside Press Enterprise _ran a wire-service story about the study, which showed an ebbing and flowing of undocumented immigrants into California, and Pastor lauded the findings because they reveal how economic trends affect the numbers.  

Marine biologists **Don Croll** and **Bernie Tershy** are using an innovative, radio-controlled cable cutter that lets them retrieve data recorders on command from the backs of surfacing whales. The _Contra Costa Times_ described how the team's research is far easier with the device, developed at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore.  

Librarians **Deborah Turner** and **Robert Guillen** were interviewed for a story in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ on "Students' Voices: Three Decades Strong"--an exhibit they've curated on the history of student expression at UCSC.   

**Craig Haney** testified recently about conditions at Pelican Bay State Prison in the trial of a man accused of killing his cellmate at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville. Haney said conditions at Pelican Bay's isolation ward, combined with "abysmal" mental health care, could have exacerbated the mental condition of the accused, who was imprisoned at Pelican Bay before the killing.
