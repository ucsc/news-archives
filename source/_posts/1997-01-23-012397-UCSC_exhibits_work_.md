SANTA CRUZ, CA--Charles Griffin Farr, one of California's great realist  painters, was honored at a reception held recently at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, to which he has donated a dozen of his paintings and  drawings.

Some 100 people attended the January 11 reception for the artist, a  longtime resident of San Francisco. The reception was held at University  House, the residence of Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, where Farr's donated  works will be on display indefinitely.

Farr, 88, was recently described by a reporter as "the grand old man of  the San Francisco art scene." He is considered a master of the American  Realist tradition. Born in 1908 in Birmingham, Alabama, Farr has been  painting for more than 70 years. In his youth, he studied in New York City and  at the Academie Americaine in Paris. Farr began his move westward after  serving in the army in World War II, arriving in San Francisco in 1948.

Farr learned of UCSC in 1990 when Rolando Castellon, the curator of  UCSC's Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery at the time, invited Farr to exhibit  his work at the gallery. Farr, who taught for nearly a decade at the San  Francisco Art Institute, was impressed by the campus's art program and  decided to make a gift of a number of his works to the Sesnon Gallery's  permanent collection. The gift follows his conviction to make his work  accessible to all where it can be used to teach art students.

"It is a delight to both live with and share with others the work of one  of America's great contemporary painters," noted Chancellor Greenwood.  "Additionally, Mr. Farr's gift will be an exceptional resource for future  generations of artists at UCSC." Following the Farr exhibition, Chancellor  Greenwood will exhibit other works of special interest to the campus and  community that will be on display for visitors to the University House.
