SANTA CRUZ, CA--The public is invited to a free lecture on  Wednesday, May 29, by UC Santa Cruz anthropologist Shelly  Errington, who will discuss the rise and fall of "authentic primitive  art" and some current transformations of related ideas and  artifacts. Her talk, entitled "The Death of Authentic Primitive Art . .  . and Other Tales of Progress," will begin at 8 p.m. in the Performing  Arts Concert Hall at UCSC.

"Primitive art," defined as the arts made by the peoples of  Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, was "discovered" as art at the  turn of the twentieth century by Cubists, says Errington, and gained  acceptance throughout the century. It reached its peak of public  acceptance and monetary value when five major exhibitions  showcased it in 1984.

In the last ten years, however, "authentic primitive art" has  "died"--in two senses, claims Errington. From a market perspective,  it is dead but more valuable than ever simply because the authentic  pieces are not being made anymore--because the international  object market and nationalist regimes of "modernization" have  changed both its accessibility and the conditions of its production.

In a second and opposite sense, it is dead conceptually because  there has been a tremendous attack in postmodern intellectual  circles on the very ideas of "authenticity" and the "primitive" and  even on "art." Errington will explore these two "deaths" in her talk,  pointing out that they are related to each other and to the global  market and conceptual conditions that produced them both. She will  also discuss new narratives and new objects that flow into the  conceptual and market spaces left by the gap produced by the death  of authentic primitive art.

Errington's talk is presented as part of a series of inaugural  lectures offered by UCSC faculty. Errington is a specialist on  Indonesia and on visual representation.
