title: Lighting Project Spotlights Energy Savings At UC Santa Cruz

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Work crews began upgrading and replacing light fixtures  on the University of California, Santa Cruz, campus earlier this month in an  effort to conserve energy.

More than 3,000 offices, laboratories, classrooms, and other spaces in  state-funded areas of the campus will gain new full-spectrum fluorescent  lights and electronic ballasts (devices which regulate the flow of  electricity). Some will even receive new lighting systems.

By installing energy-efficient lighting fixtures, the campus  anticipates reducing its use of energy for lighting by as much as 20 percent  and improving overall lighting quality, said UCSC energy manager Bob Dunn.

UC Santa Cruz is already the most energy-efficient of the nine UC  campuses based on its use of energy per square foot. With its 10,600  students and approximately 3,000 faculty and staff, UC Santa Cruz is the  third-largest consumer of electrical energy in Santa Cruz County, according  to the Pacific Gas & Electric Company.

The $1.6-million project is expected to be paid for with energy  savings over a six-year period. AMTECH Lighting Services of San Jose has  contracted with the university to perform the work, which is scheduled to  be finished in mid-June.

The relamping project is part of an overall drive by UCSC's Physical  Plant to make the campus more energy-efficient. In the future, Physical  Plant plans to install a high-efficiency air chiller in the Earth and Marine  Sciences Building and upgrade the campus's energy-management system,  which turns fans on and off and regulates air conditioning and heating  systems.
