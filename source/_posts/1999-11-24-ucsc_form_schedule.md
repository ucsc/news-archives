## Announcing December Broadcast Schedule For Ucsc Forum

Editors and News Directors:

Below is the broadcast schedule for December for UCSC Forum, which features the best of lectures and programs at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The show airs at 8 p.m. each Sunday and 4:30 p.m. each Wednesday on Community TV of Santa Cruz County, Channel 72.

December's lineup features a compelling lecture by Lani Guinier, who first gained widespread attention in 1993 when she withdrew her name from consideration as the Clinton appointee to head the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. Guinier speaks on affirmative action. Also on the schedule is a reading by Peter Gizzi, one of the country's leading young poets; a talk on obesity by UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood; a special two-and-a-half hour presentation of Mozart's whimsical opera, The Magic Flute, performed last spring by the UCSC Opera Theater; and an insightful talk by author Judy Yung on the history of the lives of Chinese women who immigrated to America in the first half of the century.
