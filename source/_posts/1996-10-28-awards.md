The winners were chosen for their renown in their fields and their contributions to their communities. The awards will be presented at a special dinner on November 22. in St. Charles.  

Economics professor **Donald Wittman** has been honored for his book _The Myth of Democratic Failure_, which has been named the Best Book in Political Economy for 1993-96 by the American Political Science Association. In the book, published in 1995 by the University of Chicago Press, Wittman uses economic analysis to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of democratic government and concludes that government is as efficient as the private sector.
