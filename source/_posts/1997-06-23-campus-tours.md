SANTA CRUZ, CA--With its long sunny days, the summer season is a  good time of year to explore the University of California, Santa Cruz,  and its off-campus facilities. Whether one wants to learn about  exotic plants, astronomy, marine mammals, or simply take a stroll  through the redwoods, UCSC offers the opportunity. Admission is  free, unless otherwise noted.

The Arboretum

Visitors to the UCSC Arboretum can stroll through its 40 acres  of gardens, learn about plants at a summer symposium, or enjoy a  program just for children. A research and teaching facility, the  Arboretum is open year-round from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, except on  Christmas. "Norrie's"--a gift shop selling plants, cut flowers,  wreaths, and books--is open Tuesday through Saturday from  10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and on Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. The Jean and Bill  Lane Horticultural Library, a nonlending library of horticultural and  botanical books, is open Wednesday through Sunday from  1 to 4 p.m. The Arboretum is located on Empire Grade between the  campus's main and west entrances.

Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems

The Center for Agroecology manages two facilities: the 25-acre Farm near the main entrance of campus and the 4-acre Alan  Chadwick Garden across McLaughlin Drive from Stevenson College. On  the Farm's docent-led tours, visitors can learn about many aspects  of organic gardening, including how to make and use compost, choose  appropriate plant varieties, and select plants that are ornamental  and attract beneficial insects. Tours of the Farm start at the gate at  noon on Thursday and 2 p.m. on Sunday, except for the first Thursday  and Sunday of the month, when docents lead tours of the Chadwick  Garden at noon and 2 p.m., respectively. Tours are canceled in the  event of rain. The Farm and the Chadwick Garden are open every day  from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. during the summer.

Starting June 3 and continuing into the fall, the Center for  Agroecology sells organically grown produce and fresh flowers each  Tuesday and Friday from noon to 6 p.m. in front of the Barn Theater  at the intersection of Bay and High Streets. The center also sponsors  a number of classes and events, including a salad-garden workshop,  poetry readings, and a harvest festival. For more information, call  (408) 459-3240.
