SANTA CRUZ, CA--Molecular biologist Charles Wilson of the  University of California, Santa Cruz, has received a $500,000  fellowship from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation of Los  Altos, the foundation announced today (October 4). Wilson is one of  twenty young researchers across the U.S. to earn the prestigious  fellowships, worth $100,000 per year for five years.

The fellowships recognize researchers who have shown  unusual creative ability in the first three years of their faculty  careers. They are designed to encourage young scientists and  engineers to pursue innovative research, partly by reducing the  time-consuming and uncertain process of competing for federal  grants.

Each year, the Packard Foundation invites about 50  universities to participate in the fellowship program, which was  established in 1988. UCSC joined the exclusive list of institutions in  1993\. Each university may nominate two members of its faculty per  year. The 1995 winners represent institutions such as Harvard,  Princeton, Yale, Caltech, MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and UC San  Francisco.

"Without question, the Packard Fellows are among the  brightest group of young people in the nation, if not the world," says  former presidential science adviser Allan Bromley of Yale, who  served on the fellowship review panel. "Prior to World War II, almost  all the leading scientists and engineers in the country were educated  through the generosity of the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations. I  believe the Packard Foundation is poised to play the same role as we  move into the 21st century."

An assistant professor of biology, Wilson is the second  scientist at UCSC to receive a Packard Fellowship. Last year,  assistant professor of chemistry Joseph Puglisi was the first. Both  Puglisi and Wilson are part of the Center for the Molecular Biology  of RNA, an interdisciplinary group of researchers at UCSC who study  the remarkable molecule RNA. A cousin of DNA, RNA performs a vast  range of critical functions in every living cell, helping to interpret  DNA's genetic instructions and to make the proteins necessary for  life.

Wilson studies the structure and function of RNA with special  techniques. First, he attempts to learn fine details about the three- dimensional layouts of the complex molecules by making crystals of  the RNAs. Probing such crystals with x-rays can reveal the exact  positions of the atoms within, which will help scientists discover  how RNA molecules actually function. Second, he uses test-tube  experiments to create new types of RNA that can carry out special  reactions. The experiments are, in effect, a rapid-fire simulation of  evolution on the early earth.

Ultimately, the efforts of Wilson and others to understand RNA  may lead to new types of drugs that interfere with particular  targets in a diseased cell. The work also will shed light on a less  practical but fascinating riddle: How did life itself arise from the  chemical stew that simmered on earth for hundreds of millions of  years? RNA, many researchers believe, played the central role in  that original birth.

Earlier this year, Wilson received his first grant as an  independent researcher from the National Institutes of Health, the  major federal funding agency for research in medicine and basic  biology. The grant will provide $349,790 in direct costs over the  next five years. Together, the NIH grant and the Packard Fellowship  will help Wilson support more researchers and students in his  laboratory and pay for advanced equipment and supplies.

Wilson, age 31, earned his B.A. in chemistry and biology and his  M.A. in cell biology in 1986, both from Boston University, and his  Ph.D. in biophysics from UC San Francisco in 1991. He was a Jane  Coffin Childs Postdoctoral Fellow for three years at the Department  of Molecular Biology of Massachusetts General Hospital before  coming to UCSC in 1994.

The David and Lucile Packard Foundation was created in 1964  to support and encourage organizations dependent on private funding  and volunteer leadership. It makes grants for programs in the arts,  community, marine biology, environment, population, education, and  children's health.
