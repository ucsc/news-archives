title: Bay Tree Bookstore And Graduate Commons Update
author: UCSC Currents
---

Crews are continuing to prepare the Bay Tree Bookstore area for the new bookstore and Graduate Commons buildings. The current work includes relocating underground utilities and excavating and shoring up the hillside where the new bookstore will be built.

Within the next few weeks, project managers expect to shut down the southbound (downhill) lane of Hagar Drive from McLaughlin Drive to the stop sign at Steinhart Way. That area will be designated as a pedestrian pathway while construction is under way. The rest of Hagar, between Steinhart and Coolidge Drive, will remain a two-way road.
