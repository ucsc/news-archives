The Space Telescope Science Institute has selected 15 young scientists for the 1997 Hubble Postdoctoral Fellowship Program. Inaugurated in 1990, the program funds research opportunities for outstanding applicants chosen from among the approximately 200 Ph.D. astronomers and astrophysicists who graduate annually. Appointed for three-year terms, Hubble Fellows conduct research of their choice related to the Hubble Space Telescope at institutions across the country.

UC Observatories/Lick Observatory, UC Santa Cruz, will host two of the latest recipients: astronomers **Karl Gebhardt** and **Henry Kobulnicky.** In addition, **Rafael Guzman,** a visiting postdoctoral researcher at UCSC, received one of the fellowships and will work at Yale University.
