The California Association of Nurserymen has bestowed its 1997 Research Award upon Professor **Ray T. Collett,** director of the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. The award recognizes Collett's contributions to the California nursery industry, the California Association of Nurserymen, and the horticultural community at large. Collett, one of the campus's original faculty members, and his staff have nurtured the Arboretum into one of the world's leading botanical sites, most notably for plants from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and California. Collett will receive his award at a banquet on September 11.
