TO THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY

**Re: Reassignment of Duties in Business and Administrative Services**

I would like to take this opportunity to share with you a recent reassignment of duties within Business and Administrative Services. This change has resulted from the departure of former Community and Land Development Director Michael A. Houlemard, Jr., who has accepted the executive directorship of the Fort Ord Reuse Authority. I believe that these organizational changes will result in greater collaboration and improved service delivery.

Effective August 1, 1997, the real estate services responsibilities of the Community Planning and Land Development Office have been reassigned to the business contracts unit in Materiel Management. Under the direction of Materiel Management Director Lisa Rose, all real estate transactions--including lease agreements, land valuation, and real estate development business affairs--will be conducted by Director Rose, Contracts Manager Jan Lester, and Contracts Analyst Sheri Damon.

Recently reassigned to Materiel Management from Accounting and Business Affairs, the Real Estate Services and Business Contracts group brings a great deal of experience and expertise to the delivery of real estate business services. In addition to other responsibilities, Director Rose served as the City of Santa Cruz's property manager for eight years, Contracts Manager Lester has over twelve years' experience interpreting and enforcing University of California policies and procedures related to real estate leases and contracts, and Contracts Analyst Damon specializes in business contracts and has five years' experience working for a local real estate attorney. We anticipate delivering more comprehensive, proactive real estate services to the campus community under this new organization.

Campus physical planning activities that have been temporarily reassigned to Assistant Vice Chancellor and Campus Architect Frank Zwart have been permanently reassigned effective September 1, 1997. These activities also include the work of the Environmental Assessment Group (EAG), now managed by Christine Aldecoa on an interim basis during Director Graham Bice's reassignment to the UC Monterey Bay Education, Science, and Technology (UCMBEST) Center project.

In addition, a recruitment for a lead physical planning staff member will take place in the next few months. This position will incorporate many of the responsibilities of the former community planning and land development position and will report to Assistant Vice Chancellor Zwart. In the short term, Senior Superintendent Dean Fitch will continue in his interim role as the campus community planning and land development director.

These new assignments are consistent with my objective to provide efficient, effective, and comprehensive services that support key campus initiatives.

Sincerely,

Thomas Vani  
Vice Chancellor Business and Administrative Services
