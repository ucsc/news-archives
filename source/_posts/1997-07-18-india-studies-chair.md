**Establishment Of Chair Coincides With The 50th Anniversary Of Indian Democracy**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A $250,000 gift from a Los Gatos, Calif., couple to the  University of California, Santa Cruz, has established one of the country's  few endowed chairs in India studies, and is the first step in a vision to  establish an international center for the study of Indian civilization and  culture.

The gift comes from Narpat and Chandra Bhandari, longtime  entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley who were both born in India. Their gift has  established the Chandra Bhandari Endowed Chair in India Studies, named in  honor of Chandra Bhandari, an educator with a lifelong interest in the  history and culture of India and the precepts and practices of nonviolence.  The announcement is timed to honor Chandra Bhandari, whose birthday is  today. "I am deeply touched by the love and affection this gift represents  from my husband," she said.

The establishment of the chair comes just a month before the 50th  anniversary of Indian independence (August 15, 1947). "Fifty years ago, India  launched the most ambitious democratic project in world history," said  Narpat Bhandari. "I believe it is vital that we devote resources to the study  of what is not only the world's largest democracy but also one of world's  oldest and most enduring cultures," added Bhandari, a recently appointed  trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation.

The endowment will fund a rich variety of activities, including  distinguished scholars-in-residence, graduate research fellowships, course  development, international conferences and symposia, the acquisition of  resources on India studies for the University Library, and activities of  faculty in the field of India studies.

"We are delighted to receive this gift," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C.  Greenwood. "Narpat and Chandra Bhandari are well respected for their  ongoing support of education both regionally and in India, having dedicated  both personal resources and their talents as educators over the years. Their  gift has established an important endowment that will be a catalyst for a  myriad of activities not only in the area but across the globe."

In making their gift, the couple stressed the importance of structuring  the chair so that it can serve as a hub for India studies activities  worldwide. "It is my earnest desire that this chair should be truly global,"  Narpat Bhandari said. "Through technology, UCSC can become an international  focal point for India studies, connecting the nine UC campuses, other  universities worldwide, and even Sojat­the tiny village where I was born.  By establishing such an infrastructure we can facilitate remarkable  collaborations in the field."

The chair will be administered through UCSC's Humanities Division,  but Humanities Dean Jorge Hankamer stressed that, "This chair is  interdisciplinary in nature and its activities will involve faculty and  students from across the divisions. The chair is unique in that we will be  able to create a significant program in India studies by leveraging our  resources through technology and collaboration."

Chandra Bhandari explained the importance of the chair's  interdisciplinary focus. "While it is valuable to examine India through the  prism of economic and political utility, it is equally important for us to  examine the country's rich history and culture as well as the living arts of  contemporary India," she said.

A four-member steering committee will oversee the chair during its  first two to three years. The committee is chaired by Dilip Basu, who is also  chair of UCSC's Committee on South and Southeast Asian Studies and  director of the Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection. "Dean Hankamer's  initiative and the Bhandaris' generosity have dramatized an India studies  presence on campus," he said. "Our existing faculty resources in South Asia  are distinctive, representing research interests in anthropology, art,  cinema, economics, the environment, and history, and their support will help  us to expand our work in India studies."

The Chandra Bhandari Chair is one of only a very few India studies  chairs in the country, according to Robert Goldman, a professor of Sanskrit  and director of the Center for South Asian Studies at UC Berkeley. Goldman,  who is a member of the UCSC steering committee, also holds a chair in India  Studies at UC Berkeley. "The Bhandaris' gift is especially important since,  nationwide, India studies has been a sadly underdeveloped discipline," he  said. The country's first chair in India studies, which was funded by  members of the Indo-American community, was established at UC Berkeley  in 1991. Since then only a few similar chairs have been established or are in  the process of development­notably, at the University of Indiana, Columbia  University, another at UC Berkeley, and, now, UCSC. "These chairs are very  few and far between," Goldman added. "I think it's remarkable that Santa  Cruz is getting involved in this field as India studies is not a widely  developed discipline on most campuses in this country."

"This chair will be an ideal vehicle for bringing Indian culture into the  public awareness today, and will take us into the 21st century, educating  our children and grandchildren about the richness and complexity of India,"  said Chandra Bhandari.

**Biographies for Narpat and Chandra Bhandari**

Narpat and Chandra Bhandari are residents of Los Gatos, California. The  couple established the Bhandari Foundation, a California charitable trust, in  1994\. The foundation has supported a number of projects in the fields of  education and medicine, notably a school near Jodhpur, India. The school  provides formal education to 350 children who could not otherwise attend  school. The Bhandaris immigrated to the United States in the early 1960s  from India.

Chandra Bhandari was born in Jodhpur, India. She has worked in the field  of education since 1965 as both a Montessori teacher and a volunteer. She  has a long-standing interest in the study of peace and nonviolence as well as  the art, history, politics, and culture of India. She received a B.A. in political  science from Rajasthan University in Jodhpur in 1960 and conducted  master's degree work in political science at both Rajasthan University and  Purdue University.

Narpat Bhandari was born in Sojat, India. He is a private Venture  Capitalist and serves as an adviser and/or board member to several  electronics companies. At TIE (The Indus Entrepreneurs), he is  engaged in a mentoring program for budding entrepreneurs.

Beginning at Signetics Corporation (now Phillips Corporation) as a  senior scientist in 1976, Bhandari designed the first I2L microprocessor and  later, at Fairchild Semiconductor, he led a 35-member team in new product  development on the design of BiCMOS technology­the heart of many high- speed digital products in use today. In 1987, Bhandari founded Aspen  Semiconductor, Inc., which has now merged with industry leader Cypress  Semiconductor Corporation of San Jose. Bhandari has more than 30 patents  and publications in the field of semiconductors, software, and HDTV (High- Definition TV).

From 1993 to 1995, Bhandari served as a board member of the federal  Indo-U.S. Subcommission on Education and Culture, a program of the United  States Information Agency.

Bhandari is a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation and the  American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, a San Francisco Bay  Area organization. He is cofounder and a charter member of The Indus  Entrepreneurs (TiE) of Santa Clara, and held a global chair for the group from  its inception until 1996. He received the Entrepreneur of the Year award in  1992 from the National Federation of Indian Associations.

Bhandari has taught a range of courses on electronics at numerous  institutions, including UC Extension, the University of Southern California,  Purdue University, and Northeastern University in Boston. He received a  B.S.E.E. in telecommunications from the Birla Institute of Technology in  Pilani, India, in 1961 and an M.S.E.E. with highest honors from Purdue  University in 1963. He also engaged in additional graduate work in business  management at UCLA and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
