author: Barbara McKenna

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Sociologist Nancy Stoller will present a slide  show and talk titled, "Racial Prescriptions and Sexual Permissions:  When AIDS Educators Send Us to Bed" at 8 p.m. Tuesday, May 9, in the  Performing Arts Concert Hall at the University of California, Santa  Cruz. The talk is free and open to the public.

Stoller is a professor of community studies and director of  UCSC's Women's Health Institute. Her talk, presented as part of the  UCSC Inaugural Lecture series, will be based in part on a book she is  working on titled, Lessons from the Damned: Queers, Whores, and  Junkies Respond to AIDS. She will also discuss her research  addressing different representations of race and sexual orientation  in AIDS safe sex materials. Using slides of brochures and posters  currently in use, she will demonstrate that racial representations  differ in such materials depending on whether their focus is on  heterosexual or gay and lesbian groups.

Inaugural Lectures are presented to celebrate a UCSC faculty  member's promotion or appointment to the position of full professor.  Faculty members are invited to present a talk for general audiences  based on an area of current research or interest.

Stoller's work focuses on race and gender aspects of health,  encompassing AIDS, breast cancer, the politics of women's health,  gay and lesbian studies, and community organizing. She is founder  and former director of women's programs for the San Francisco AIDS  Foundation, a position she held from 1984-87. At UCSC, Stoller has  served as acting provost of Kresge College and as chair of the  Community Studies Board. She is the co-editor with Beth Schneider  of the just-published book, Women Resisting AIDS: Feminist  Strategies of Empowerment (Philadelphia: Temple University Press,  1995).

Inaugural Lectures are presented by UCSC Arts & Lectures and  supported by the Offices of the Chancellor and Executive Vice  Chancellor, the Council of Provosts, and University Affiliates. For  more information, call (408) 459-2159 (voice or TDD).
