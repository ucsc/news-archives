Research physicist **Michael Riordan** has received $50,000 from the Richard Lounsbery Foundation for the purpose of writing a scholarly book on the history of the now-defunct superconducting super collider, titled "Tunnel Visions: The Rise and Fall of the Superconducting Super Collider." His last book, _Crystal Fire: The Birth of the Information Age,_ which details the history of the transistor and the microchip, received positive critical review and extensive media attention.

**Marc Mangel,** a professor in environmental studies and the Institute of Marine Sciences, has been awarded the Dozor Visiting Fellowship by Ben-Gurion University in Israel. The fellowship will allow Mangel to travel to Israel this fall, where he will interact on an informal basis with faculty and graduate students and present seminars on his research.
