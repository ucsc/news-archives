SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California, Santa Cruz, has  received a $100,000 grant from the William and Flora Hewlett  Foundation to develop an innovative college program in U.S.  Intercultural Studies designed to promote cultural understanding and  unity. UC Santa Cruz was chosen in part because its eight residential  colleges provide a unique opportunity to integrate academic and co- curricular approaches to learning.

The UCSC effort, which was funded by the foundation's  Pluralism and Unity Program, will offer courses that compare at  least two cultural groups in the United States and complementary  nonclass activities at each of the colleges, such as public lectures,  dances, movies, and conferences.

As American society becomes increasingly diverse, the  challenge for educators is to help mold a unified democratic society.  The goal of the U.S. Intercultural Studies Program is to "find unity  within diversity," says John Isbister, provost of UCSC's Merrill  College and coordinator of the program.

The program reflects UCSC's commitment to diversity and to  fostering a deeper understanding among ethnic groups, says UCSC  Chancellor Karl S. Pister. "This program will help our students  understand and value the rich array of perspectives that a diverse  populace contributes to American culture," says Pister. "Through  historical analysis and firsthand experience, they will gain respect  for how diversity strengthens society and the democratic process."

Each of the eight participating faculty members will develop a  course based at one of the colleges that will be offered once each  year during the initial two-year pilot phase of the program. There  will be no restrictions on the disciplinary nature of the classes,  which could focus on history, literature, economics, art, biology,  politics, religion, or any other field or combination of fields. Co- curricular activities will be available to all students, not just those  enrolled in the courses.

Planning will begin this summer, and the first courses will  likely be offered next winter, says Isbister. The program includes an  assessment component to evaluate the success of the courses and  activities and to determine whether the program has affected  cultural attitudes. One of the goals of the program is to increase  empathy for and interest in other cultures, and faculty members will  develop tools with which to measure attitude changes, says Isbister.

"American culture is obviously very diverse," says Isbister.  "But there's also something unique about being an American.  Sometimes there is tension between diversity and pluralism. This  program is geared toward exploring how people who are different  figure out what they have in common with each other and how to live  constructively together."

Since 1985, the college "core courses" required for first-year  students have addressed issues of diversity, so the U.S. Intercultural  Studies Program builds on a well-developed theme, says Isbister.  The new courses will be aimed at sophomores and junior transfers  and will build on the core courses, he noted. They will range in size  from lecture courses to seminar classes.

The program will also enhance UCSC's college system, which  was envisioned by the campus's founders as a way to create small  lively communities that would help break down the boundaries  between academic disciplines, says Isbister. The founders also  hoped the colleges would provide a common basis of understanding  among students with different academic interests. Today, each of  the eight colleges has a membership of 1,000 to 1,300  undergraduate students, about 50 faculty fellows, and about 12 staff  people, and all of the colleges share a commitment to providing a  living environment that honors diversity.

"This campus has a commitment to diversity and is looking for  effective ways to develop the curriculum in those directions," says  Isbister.

UCSC alumni are supportive of the residential college system,  and the UCSC Alumni Association has contributed $28,000 toward  the U.S. Intercultural Studies Program. Other campus funds bring the  total for the initial phase of the program to $153,000. Coordinators  anticipate that a successful program will lead to a reallocation of  campus funds to ensure the program's continuance.

The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation was established in  1966 by Palo Alto industrialist William R. Hewlett, his late wife  Flora, and their son, Walter, to promote the well-being of mankind  by supporting select activities. The national foundation has focused  on supporting activities in education, performing arts, population,  environment, conflict resolution, and family and community  development. In the past, the foundation has supported UCSC's  Institute of Marine Sciences, Environmental Studies Field and  Internship Program, and Shakespeare Santa Cruz. It also provided  major support for fellowships to South African students.
