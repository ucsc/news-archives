SANTA CRUZ, CA--Rain-laden tempests driven by El Nino could  batter the Central Coast this winter and wreak havoc on the  environment, if you trust the headlines. The question is, should you?  That's what four leading Monterey Bay Area scientists will try to  address on Tuesday, November 4, during a set of public lectures  titled "El Nino: Fact or Fiction?"

The talks will run from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Louden Nelson  Community Center, 301 Center St., Santa Cruz. Admission is $5 for  members of the Friends of Long Marine Lab, sponsors of the event,  and $6 for the general public. Proceeds will benefit public education  programs at Long Marine Lab, a coastal marine research station  operated by UC Santa Cruz.

Each of the four speakers will talk for 20 minutes, followed by  a panel discussion and questions from the audience. The speakers,  and synopses of their topics, are as follows:
* Francisco Chavez, associate scientist at the Monterey Bay  Aquarium Research Institute: "El Nino and oceanic productivity."  Chavez will discuss how El Nino changes the normal patterns of  upwelling along the coasts of North and South America, and the  resulting effects on food sources in the ocean.
* Gary Griggs, director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences:  "The potential impacts of an El Nino winter on the Monterey Bay  shoreline." Griggs, an expert on coastal erosion, will review the  major oceanfront damage caused by the last major El Nino (1982- 83). He also will preview what might occur in the coming months.
* James Harvey, professor of biology at Moss Landing Marine  Laboratories: "The potential impacts of El Nino on marine mammals  in the Monterey Bay Area." Harvey will talk about how an altered  food chain might influence the marine sanctuary's abundant  mammals.
* Giacomo Bernardi, assistant professor of biology at UCSC:  "Effects of El Nino events on central California fish populations."  Unusual fish appear along the coast during an El Nino. Bernardi will  talk about these species, as well as possible consequences for the  bay's usual denizens.
