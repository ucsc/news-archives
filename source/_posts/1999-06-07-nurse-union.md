UC and California Nurses Association (CNA) have reached tentative agreement on a new contract for nurses employed at the university's medical centers and student health facilities.

The contract, which must be ratified by a vote of the union membership, includes wage increases that will help UC stay competitive in the current nursing market.

"We are pleased to have reached tentative agreement on a new contract for UC nurses, who provide such important services to the people of California," said Gayle Cieszkiewicz, UC director of labor relations. "This agreement demonstrates once again the success that can be achieved when both parties are committed to serious bargaining and view the reaching of an agreement as their primary objective."

The previous contract for UC nurses was to have expired April 30 but was extended to provide for continued negotiations on the new contract.

By agreement of both parties, details of the tentative pact will be withheld until the union membership has an opportunity to review the pact and vote on ratification.
