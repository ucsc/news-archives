**Grant Hartzog:** Assistant Professor of Biology

Grant Hartzog studies gene expression and regulation in yeast, focusing on the role of the protein-DNA complex known as chromatin. In yeast, as in all higher organisms, the DNA of chromosomes is stored in the nucleus as chromatin, in which the DNA strand is wrapped around special protein molecules. Hartzog is investigating how the chromatin structure influences the activity of genes. Hartzog received his B.A. degree in biophysics from UC Berkeley and his Ph.D. in biochemistry and biophysics from UC San Francisco. Before joining the UCSC faculty he was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School.
