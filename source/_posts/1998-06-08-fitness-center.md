A groundbreaking ceremony will mark the start of construction on a 10,600-square-foot weight training and fitness center for the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports.

A number of activities are planned for the groundbreaking event on Tuesday, June 9, including a traditional shovel ceremony, a wellness fair with holistic health activities including massage and acupressure, community drumming, a barbecue dinner, and the rock band Sista Monica.

The traditional shovel ceremony will include short speeches by Chancellor Greenwood and student leaders; Dan Wood, director of the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports; Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor of Student Affairs; and Anita Diaz, director of the Student Health Center.

The event is free and open to all members of the campus community. Students with dining-hall contracts may eat for free; others may purchase their dinners for $6.50.

The Fitness Center will be a two-story building overlooking the Monterey Bay and equipped with "state-of-the-art" cardiovascular, strength, and flexibility machines. The downstairs area will be primarily used for university physical-conditioning classes, athletic teams, fitness testing, rehabilitation, and other group instruction. The upper floor will be available for drop-in use by students, staff, faculty, and community members. Each floor will have a set of cardiovascular, strength, and flexibility machines.

Approved by student voters in the spring 1996 elections, the $4-million facility is expected to be completed for opening in fall 1999. The project also includes improvements to the upper east playing field, swimming pool lighting, and storage and maintenance buildings.
