title: Are Women Faculty Underpaid? Gender Equity In Faculty Salaries Will Be The Topic On April 16

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Are female faculty underpaid? The question quickly  triggers a host of follow-up queries, such as how do you weigh productivity?  How do you compare the productivity of faculty artists and scientists?  Should faculty research be reviewed independent of teaching performance?

Ronald Oaxaca, a professor of economics at the University of Arizona,  has been addressing these issues in his work on gender salary equity at the  University of Arizona. Oaxaca will give a public talk about his ongoing  research at 4 P.M. on April 16 in the Kresge Town Hall at UC Santa Cruz. His  talk is titled "Faculty Salary Determination: Do Gender and Productivity  Matter?" Admission is free, and a reception will follow the lecture.

Oaxaca's talk is sponsored by UCSC's Economics Department, where he  is visiting for two weeks at the invitation of UCSC Chancellor M.R.C.  Greenwood, who appointed him to a Chancellor's Lectureship.

Oaxaca, who has spent years researching the broader issue of gender  equity, began examining faculty salary equity at the University of Arizona  two years ago when UA's Board of Regents requested information on the  subject.

A "snapshot" examination of male and female salaries at UA revealed  "a definite salary gap," says Oaxaca, but the findings lacked credibility  because the comparison didn't adjust for things like field of study, college  affiliation, prior experience, or rank.

In a more detailed follow-up study that attempts to control for  productivity, Oaxaca estimates that the average salary difference between  comparable men and women ranges between 7 and 10 percent.

Those estimates are the result of a year's work spent interpreting  curriculum vitae, or biographical sketches, of faculty in the university's  education and business schools, says Oaxaca, who has devised methods to  weigh the relative value of journal articles, books, monographs, and other  forms of research. The research has been carried out by Oaxaca and his  graduate assistant, Iris Geisler.

Faculty at the University of Arizona have been supportive of the  project, and Oaxaca has gathered CVs of almost all the faculty in an attempt  to assess the quantity--if not the quality--of research produced by each  professor. "We can't control for the quality of research--our assumption has  to be that women publish the same quality as men--but we do control for the  quantity," he said.

Despite his discovery of apparent disparities, Oaxaca urges  universities to consider each case individually. "No matter how  sophisticated the statistics are, ultimately it comes down to individuals  and the merits of individual cases," he said. Oaxaca believes settlements or  salary adjustments should be based on individual accomplishments.

One avenue is for universities to offer faculty members an opportunity  to request a salary equity review if they feel they are being paid less than  colleagues with comparable accomplishments. Oaxaca said it would be a  mistake to follow in the footsteps of Northern Arizona University and  Virginia Commonwealth University, however, which conducted studies  without adequate controls a few years ago and concluded that women faculty  were underpaid. Salaries for women at Virginia were increased across the  board, but the action triggered a lawsuit by five men on the faculty who  charged discrimination, according to reports in the Chronicle of Higher  Education.

"I've cautioned my deans here to make any adjustments on the facts of  each case," said Oaxaca. "To give everyone a set increase does an injustice to  those men and women who should've gotten more."

Ideally, faculty comparisons would weigh all aspects of faculty  performance, including teaching and public service contributions, said  Oaxaca. But there are problems with every scenario, he noted.

"What if salary formulas are the same for women and men in given  fields but women choose to specialize in areas that don't pay as well? How  do you handle that?" he asked. "A university does make judgments about what  it considers important. At a research university, research will always be  considered primary. If women concentrate on teaching, they're going to get  paid less. So do you change the institution?"

"Let's air these issues and get them on the table," concluded Oaxaca.
