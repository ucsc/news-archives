SANTA CRUZ, CA--What's the secret to successful leadership?  Vision? Organization? Speaking style? Try confidence. And  optimism.

Those two qualities have a major impact on the effectiveness  of leaders, says Martin Chemers, a professor of psychology at the  University of California, Santa Cruz. Chemers will discuss  leadership during a talk entitled "Heavy Mettle: The Role of  Confidence and Optimism in Leadership Effectiveness." The event  will be held on Tuesday, April 9, at 7:30 p.m. in Room A340 of the  Earth and Marine Sciences Building at UCSC. The event, which is  sponsored by Sigma Xi, is free and open to the public.

"Very little research has approached the question of the  emotional aspects of leadership--how belief in one's abilities and  optimism about the future affects leadership performance," says  Chemers, a social psychologist who specializes in leadership and  organizational psychology. Chemers and two colleagues have  broadened the field of leadership by studying subjects as varied as  ROTC cadets and college basketball teams to learn how a leader's  beliefs in his or her abilities affect performance.

"We've found that leaders' confidence in their abilities and  optimism about their actions is inspiring to others," says Chemers.  "It helps them persevere in the face of difficulty, they set high  standards and generate enthusiasm, and they're able to maintain  their demeanor in the face of stress. These characteristics are a  major part of what makes effective leadership."

Chemers, who is also dean of the Division of Social Sciences at  UCSC, came to UCSC in 1995 from Claremont McKenna College, where  he collaborated with Susan Murphy, a professor of psychology, and  Carl Watson, now a graduate student at the University of Michigan. In  addition to the ROTC and basketball studies, the three have studied  government workers and are working on studies of Army officers and  managers of fast-food franchises. Chemers has also undertaken a  major study of the confidence and optimism of first-year students  at UCSC.

Sigma Xi is an honor society founded in 1886 with the goals of  encouraging original work in science and technology and fostering  creative interactions between researchers and society. Parking for  the talk is available near the Science Library or at Cowell Student  Health Center.
