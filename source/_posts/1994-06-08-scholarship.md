Recipients of the awards were announced today (Wednesday,  June 8), during an awards ceremony at University House. The awards  are the Deans' Undergraduate Awards, the Chancellor's Undergraduate  Awards, and the Presidential Awards.

The awards were established to encourage and stimulate  outstanding scholarship and creative activity among undergraduate  students. Nominees were evaluated for work developed in courses or  programs at UCSC.
