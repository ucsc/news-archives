## Fat Liberation Activist Nomy Lamm To Speak At UCSC November 10

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Nomy Lamm, a leading activist in the fat liberation movement, will deliver a lecture at UC Santa Cruz on Wednesday, November 10, at 7 p.m. Her talk, "It's a Big, Fat Revolution!" will take place in Classroom Unit 2 and is free and open to the public.

Lamm is a self-described "fat freaky disabled anarchist jew dyke," as well as a freelance writer, lecturer, and performance artist. She lives in Olympia, Washington, and is a graduate of Evergreen State College. Named one of Ms. magazine's "Women of the Year" in 1997 for her work fighting fat oppression, Lamm recently released her first full-length CD of music and spoken word on Olympia's Talent Show Recordings. Her writings have appeared in numerous anthologies, including Adios, Barbie: Young Women Write About Body Image and Identity and Listen Up: Voices from the Next Feminist Generation. Her articles have appeared in magazines such as Ms., Seventeen, and HUES. Lamm spent the past summer touring with Sister Spit, the San Francisco-based all-girl spoken-word road show. She is currently writing a full-length rock opera that will premiere next July.
