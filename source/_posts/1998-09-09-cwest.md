## UC Santa Cruz Sociologist Honored For Her Work

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Candace West, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been honored for her work by the Sex and Gender Section of the American Sociological Association.

West received the annual "Distinguished Article in Gender Award" for her article, "Doing Difference," which she coauthored with Sarah Fenstermaker, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

The Sex and Gender Section is the largest of ASA's sections, reflecting the amount of interest in the topic. West's article was selected by a four-person committee, one member of which referred to the piece as "an instant 'classic.'"

Ronnie J. Steinberg, professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University and chair of the committee, said the article "raised standards of intellectual discourse about the intersection of gender, race, and class and moved scholarship on gender forward, offering innovative analytic possibilities. This article cannot be ignored."

The article appeared in the journal Gender and Society, and the response prompted the journal to hold a symposium with short reaction pieces written by some of the most influential writers on gender and race.
