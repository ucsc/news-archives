SANTA CRUZ, CA--The San Francisco-based architectural firm of  Esherick Homsey Dodge & Davis has received an "honor award with  distinction" in the 1994 awards program of the American Institute  of Architects, California Council, for its design of the striking  Science Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Just one other project received the honor award with  distinction, the top prize in the statewide competition. Of the 220  entrants, 9 other architectural firms earned honor awards for their  buildings, while 8 received merit awards.

"UCSC has a long tradition of excellent architecture, and the  Science Library is a proud addition to our campus," says Frank Zwart,  campus architect and assistant vice chancellor for physical planning  and construction. "It does everything that a university building  should, and more. It meets the functional demands of a contemporary  library economically and efficiently; it knits together the campus's  major science building complex with a simple terrace plaza; and it  creates an elegant interior that invites a spectacular forest setting  indoors."

The Science Library opened in 1991, reunifying the 230,000  volumes of the University Library's science collection and offering  the latest methods of electronically retrieving bibliographic data.  Construction costs for the 74,000-square-foot building totaled  $13.5 million. The building nestles comfortably among towering  redwood trees; zigs and zags in its walls and floor-to-ceiling  windows give readers the illusion of sitting outside.

The library has won other kudos for its design and  functionality. Previous awards include a 1993 Award of Excellence  for Library Architecture from the  American Institute of Architects and the American Library  Association, and a 1994 CRSI Design Award from the Concrete  Reinforcing Steel Institute. The S. J. Amoroso Construction Company  of Foster City built the library.

Esherick Homsey Dodge & Davis has designed other buildings at  UCSC, most notably Stevenson College and the Long Marine  Laboratory, as well as the popular Monterey Bay Aquarium.
