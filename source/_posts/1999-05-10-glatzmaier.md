**Gary Glatzmaier:** Professor of Earth Sciences

Gary Glatzmaier is a geophysicist who develops sophisticated computer models to simulate the internal fluid dynamics of planets and stars. Glatzmaier's computer simulations show how the motion of molten metal in the Earth's outer core generates the Earth's magnetic field. These models also help explain the occasional reversals of the Earth's magnetic field seen in the geologic record. Glatzmaier is also interested in working with astronomers to understand the internal dynamics of newly discovered planets outside the solar system. Glatzmaier received his B.S. in physics and mathematics from Marquette University in Milwaukee and his Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of Colorado in Boulder. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he worked for 16 years at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. He is a fellow of the American Geophysical Union and of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
