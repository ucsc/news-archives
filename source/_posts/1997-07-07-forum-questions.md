title: Chancellor Greenwood's Forum Questions
author: UCSC Currents

** Here are all of the questions that were submitted for Chancellor Greenwood's  consideration before her meeting with staff on June 24:**

** 1\. Kim Seidl, Assistant to the Merrill Provost, Pottery Co-Op Coordinator; also  anonymously submitted **

My question relates to pay scales in comparison to other UC campuses. I saw  a report on CNN the other night that said that the two most expensive places  to live in the U.S. (based on housing costs) were Honolulu, Hawaii, and Santa  Cruz, California.

While the overall cost of living in Santa Cruz is very high (second only to San  Francisco), our salaries rank below that of our colleagues at many other UC  campuses (e.g., San Diego, Davis, and Berkeley). As chancellor, what steps will  you take to advocate for comparable employee compensation and salaries  that reflect sensitively to the high cost of living in this community?

What competencies would you like the current staff to develop to meet the  challenges of a somewhat tight budgetary time and the new technologies that  impact workload?

** 3\. The following are concerns voiced collectively by the African American  Faculty & Staff Association: **
* In light of President Clinton's expressed concern about status of the United  States race relations at the UCSD graduation ceremony, what if anything is  our current UCSC administration planning to do to acknowledge and address  these concerns, in reference to students, faculty, and staff?
* Who is responsible for the development of an academic curriculum which  reflects the African American experience?
* What can be done to implement an Afrocentric curriculum in all boards of  studies?
* What measures can be taken to address the depletion of African American  staff on the UCSC campus?
* Thanks to UCSC administration many of the recommendations specified in  the African American Faculty & Staff Charette (LB2331.73.C2A37 1990  McHenry) have been addressed and progress towards resolution is being  made. This especially includes the creation of the Diversity Education  Program, the African American Resource & Cultural Center, and the African  American Faculty and Staff Caucus. One concern that persists, especially in  the absence of affirmative action policies, is a "dual workload" many staff of  color face. That is, we complete our primary duties and additionally, students  of color turn to us for support in what they perceive as a racially  insensitive environment. This added "workload" occurs regardless of  whether or not staff of color work in one of the formal, campus "support"  units (i.e., Psychological Counseling, etc.). How does the current  administration  address the climate of race on this campus, especially as it pertains to this  "dual workload" issue?

I was drawn to work at UCSC because of its diversity and its attention to the  damage that racism inflicts on individuals and societies. And, in fact, many  staff here are committed to eliminating racism, promoting pluralism, and  working toward collaboration and conciliation across race and ethnicity. Some  staff, however, seem to feel a degree of anger and mistrust toward coworkers  of different ethnic and racial backgrounds that limits productivity  and promotes misunderstanding and conflict. Even more disturbing, some  staff seem to advise students that people of ethnic and racial backgrounds  different from theirs cannot be trusted to offer either good will  or assistance. I don't want to  dishonor any individual staffer's particular experiences or  thinking around ethnicity and race, but I feel deeply concerned about how  we are relating to each other as staff and how we are preparing students for  a diverse world.

What more can be done to ease ethnic and racial conflict and polarization  among staff members?

** 5\. Submitted by the American Indian Staff and Faculty Association **

At one of the post-209 general meetings, a faculty member stated that he felt  that certain minority groups on campus would feel welcome and no sense of  a "hostile environment towards their concerns." Chancellor Greenwood, how  do you plan on educating faculty members to be aware and sensitive to the  reality, concerns, and problems that students of color face on the UCSC  campus?

The Chancellor's Commission on Prop. 209 met in May of this year for a  general meeting before the open forum. During the meeting a faculty  member expressed that UCSC was a welcoming place for students of color. He  was then called on this comment about the reality of the situation here. The  people who informed him that statement was untrue were from staff and  students on the commission. Realizing that not all faculty are ignorant  to the fact  that this place is a hostile environment to some groups on campus, if they  don't know or haven't been able to recognize the problem then they need to  be informed. Our question is:

Are you aware that there are faculty that don't believe that UCSC has racial  problems and that they think our image in the community among the people  of color is favorable? How do you plan to inform and educate our faculty  that we do have these problems and what they as professors can do to make  this a better environment for the students?

I know that bureaucratic and academic workplaces are always challenging,  but it seems to me that at UCSC we have somehow created a culture of  exceptional meanness, at least in some work areas. I feel particularly  concerned about how often coworkers openly shout at one another (or do  not speak to each other at all), complaints are filed over issues that would be  shrugged off in other workplaces, intensive mediation and conflict resolution  are needed to maintain basic functioning in offices, grudges are held and  vengeance is sought for extended periods, and angry staff reject direct,  constructive criticism in favor of confrontation or hidden retaliation. As a  result, many of us work in an atmosphere of anger and mistrust, feel scared  to innovate or collaborate, sink into low morale or even hopelessness, and try  to devote as little energy as possible to our jobs. Improvements in workload,  salary, and benefits would clearly bring some changes for the better, but I  suspect much more is needed to change our work culture.

What are your thoughts about how to heal what one of my colleagues has  called the "bad medicine" on this campus?

Some university employees, including myself, fear reprisal should they  express concern regarding salaries, benefits, or compensation. Observational  data suggest that reprisals take the form of layoffs or threats of outsourcing.  It is my opinion that the university has adopted a  "Management by Intimidation" philosophy. Please respond to this comment.

Although the University of California professes not to discriminate on the  basis of sexual orientation, discrimination pervades the system. For example,  lesbian couples with children are not eligible to live at Family Student  Housing. Domestic partners of gays and lesbians are not eligible for benefits.  Do you plan to speak up for more enlightened policy systemwide, and what  do you plan to do to bring equity to this campus?

** 9\. Maggie Collins, Service Center Coordinator **

Given that we are facing two more years of budget cuts and growing student  enrollments, how are you planning to fund the new initiatives without taking  it out of the overextended, existing budgets?

** 10\. Submitted Anonymously **

Will this be a one-time only event, or can we count on you as chancellor to  make yourself accessible to the concerns of the UCSC staff? What methods  will you use to inform us of investigation, consideration, and/or decisions  regarding the concerns that have been expressed today?

** 11\. Submitted Anonymously **

What is the evaluation process for unit managers?

There is the impression in my unit that the manager isn't being  evaluated on any regular basis because we haven't been asked for  feedback about our manager for several years.

** 12\. Submitted Anonymously **

What are the characteristics that you value in the staff?

What advice would you give to new staff about UCSC as a workplace and how  to make a successful career here?

Do you have any tips on time management and keeping the big picture in  mind?

Within these times of post-209 policies and constant labor disputes, how do  you keep such a positive attitude? How did you learn to juggle such an  ambitious schedule?

** 13\. Heidi Renteria, Outreach Volunteers Coordinator, Admissions **

Why should staff members have to pay for OPERS Rec Cards? Staffers who  make use of the recreational facilities are less stressed and healthier, thus  reducing both absences and health care costs. I think that FREE rec cards  would be a very welcome and cost-effective benefit of working for UCSC.

** 14\. David Holder, Physical Plant Lockshop **

Why does the university force staff employees to use earned vacation leave,  sick leave, comp time, or leave without pay at the campus holiday closure  period? Can you quote any recent studies showing the cost/benefits of  continuing with a campus closure? If there are any benefits, do the savings  come from energy-cost savings or salary-cost savings?

** 15\. Lark Letchworth, Natural Sciences Business Office **

When will UCSC have a clearly stated plan and policy on smoking which  provides smokers with designated smoking areas which are out of the  weather, and provides nonsmokers with smoke-free access to the campus?

** 16\. Submitted Anonymously **

Tell us more about the interdisciplinary sciences building. When will it break  ground? When will it be completed? When can we move in?
