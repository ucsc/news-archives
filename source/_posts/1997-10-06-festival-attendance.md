More than 1,000 people visited the UCSC Farm and the Alan Chadwick Garden over the weekend as part of the festivities marking the 30th anniversary of the Farm & Garden.

Chancellor Greenwood attended a reception in the Alan Chadwick Garden on Friday evening.

The Banana Slug String Band headlined the special anniversary edition of the annual Harvest Festival on Saturday, which was packed with revelers young and old. Pumpkin painting and potato prints were among the most popular activities for the youngsters, while adults enjoyed Farm tours, workshops, and garden talks.

A benefit dinner on Saturday night sold out, with more than 400 people enjoying a gourmet vegetarian meal prepared by some of the area's most well-known chefs. Among those making remarks were Social Sciences dean Martin Chemers and Carol Shennan, the new director of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. Former UCSC apprentice Cathrine Sneed of The Garden Project, a garden training program for prisoners and ex-inmates in San Francisco, gave an inspiring keynote address about the role that gardening can play in changing the lives of the socially disadvantaged.

The celebration wrapped up Sunday morning with a symposium attended by alumni of the apprenticeship program, who discussed their work in farming, education, and community development.
