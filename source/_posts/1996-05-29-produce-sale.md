SANTA CRUZ, CA--Bouquets of aromatic sweet peas and clusters of  dramatic sunflowers are two of the most popular items sold at the  organic produce and flower stand at UC Santa Cruz, and they'll be  back this year when the cart opens on Tuesday, June 4.

The market cart features picked-that-morning fruit,  vegetables, and flowers that are grown organically at the UCSC Farm  and the Alan Chadwick Garden. Located at the main entrance of  campus, the market cart will be open every Tuesday and Friday  afternoon from noon until 6 p.m. in front of the Barn Theater at the  intersection of Bay and High streets.

In addition to sweet peas and sunflowers, this year's early  flower selection will include larkspur, alstromeria, foxglove,  coreopsis, calendula, feverfew, and sages that include Mexican  flannel sage and candelabra sage.

The array of fresh organic fruits and vegetables grows as the  season progresses, but gourmet salad mix, tender lettuces, and  sweet carrots will top the list early in the season. As summer  approaches, the bounty from the UCSC Farm and Garden will include  strawberries, sweet corn, flavorful dry-farmed tomatoes, an array  of sweet and hot peppers, several varieties of potatoes, apples,  plums, basil and other herbs, and more.

The cart will be open through the summer and into the fall,  depending on the length of the growing season. All proceeds benefit  the UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Agriculture's  apprenticeship program in ecological horticulture. For more  information, call (408) 459-4140.
