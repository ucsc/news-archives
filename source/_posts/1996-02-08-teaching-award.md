SANTA CRUZ, CA--Mathematician Edward M. Landesman of the  University of California, Santa Cruz, is one of three professors to  earn a leading national award in recognition of distinguished  teaching in mathematics.

Landesman received the 1996 Deborah and Franklin Tepper  Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of  Mathematics at a recent meeting of the Mathematical Association of  America and the American Mathematical Society. Established in  1991, the award honors teachers "who are widely recognized as  extraordinarily successful and whose teaching effectiveness clearly  has had an influence beyond their own institutions."

"Landesman's effectiveness as a teacher encompasses the full  mathematics curriculum," reads part of his award citation.  "Whenever he teaches in the core courses required or encouraged of  majors, enrollments surge. Students often put off taking a course  until he teaches it."

One of Landesman's former students, now a college  mathematics teacher, provided this testimonial: "I can't emphasize  enough the significant role Ed has played in shaping both my  mathematics and teaching careers. Ed's successes as a teacher are  reflected in his popularity among undergraduate and graduate  students and serve as a model and inspiration to me. It is with the  utmost respect and admiration that I reflect upon Ed's teaching and  acknowledge how fortunate I was to be instructed by the greatest  teacher I have ever known."

The other recipients of this year's award, which carries a cash  prize of $1,000, are professors Thomas F. Banchoff of Brown  University and Herbert S. Wilf of the University of Pennsylvania.

Landesman earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from UCLA and joined  the UCSC faculty in 1966. He has served as provost of Crown College  and as associate academic vice chancellor for undergraduate  education. He is interested in the teaching of mathematics at all  levels and has spent many years working with teachers at primary  and secondary schools. His peers and students have recognized his  efforts with several other honors, including the Distinguished  Teaching Award from the UCSC Alumni Association in 1984 and an  Excellence in Teaching Award from the Northern California  Association of Phi Beta Kappa in 1987.
