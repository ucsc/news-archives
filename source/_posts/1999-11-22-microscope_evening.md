UC Santa Cruz Biology Department Presents "an Evening At The Microscope" On December 12

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Biology Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, invites members of the Santa Cruz community to spend "An Evening at the Microscope" on Sunday, December 12. Biology Department staff will guide participants in observing a variety of fascinating specimens through high-quality microscopes.

This free public event will be held from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. in the Kenneth V. Thimann Laboratories Building, Room 239, on the UCSC campus. The event is limited to 20 participants and may not be appropriate for children under 14.

There will be a brief introduction to use of the instruments, after which participants will use stereoscopic microscopes to examine items congenial to their own interests. A variety of materials will be available for viewing, and participants are encouraged to bring their own specimens (bugs, flowers, small rocks, etc.) to share. There will also be an opportunity to create permanent images of the specimens.

This event may be of particular interest to local kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) science teachers, students with science fair projects involving microscopy, and those considering the purchase of their own microscope. Although the event is free to the public, voluntary donations will be gratefully accepted. Any contributions will be used to directly support UCSC's efforts to enhance science instruction in local K-12 schools.
