**'Asteroid San Jose' Is A Tribute To The City's Longtime Support Of  Lick Observatory**

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Representatives of the University of California,  Santa Cruz, and Lick Observatory presented the San Jose City  Council on Tuesday (May 19) with a commemorative photograph  of an asteroid that has been named in honor of the Silicon Valley city.

The naming designation was done to acknowledge the city's  longtime efforts to work cooperatively with Lick staff--a  partnership that has helped keep the 110-year-old mountaintop  facility one of astronomy's most productive observatories.

Observatory staff and the asteroid's discoverer, S.J. Bus, had  successfully petitioned the International Astronomical Union to  name the asteroid after San Jose.

Presenting a framed digital image of Asteroid San Jose--and  an accompanying short essay about the celestial body--to the city  council were M.R.C. Greenwood, chancellor of UC Santa Cruz, and  Joseph Miller, director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory.

In her remarks to the council, the chancellor paid particular  tribute to the city's efforts to control the type of light its  neighborhoods emit--too much of the wrong kind of light can  impair Lick Observatory's ability to capture clear and concise  images from the night sky. "We recognize the century-old spirit of  collaboration with you, as well as the city's ongoing efforts to keep  ambient light-levels low by installing low-pressure sodium  streetlights," Chancellor Greenwood said. "Low-light levels have  permitted observing from Mount Hamilton to continue at  extremely productive levels."

The proclamation she and Miller presented to the council  underscored the relationship between the city and observatory:  "Located 20 miles to the east at the 4,200-foot summit of Mount  Hamilton, Lick Observatory is easily visible from almost any  neighborhood or street in San Jose," the proclamation read.  "Through the city's understanding and efforts, the whole universe  is still visible from Lick Observatory."

San Jose is the 6,216th asteroid to be discovered. Traveling  in an orbit between Mars and Jupiter, it is estimated to be 10 to  15 miles across--about the same size as the city of San Jose.  Discovered by Bus in September 1975, the asteroid was given the  temporary designation "1975 SJ" when its orbit was first  computed. It is coincidental that the original designation, the  initials of the discover's name, and the initials of the city of San  Jose are all "S.J."

A part of the University of California since its inception, Lick  Observatory has been affiliated with UC Santa Cruz since 1966. In  its glorious history, astronomers at the observatory have made a  number of important findings, including the discovery of Jupiter's  fifth satellite by Edward Emerson Barnard in the observatory's  fourth year of operation, in 1892. Lick astronomers also  collaborated with astronauts during a 1969 Moon walk to  determine the precise distance between the Earth and the Moon  and to confirm that the Moon is gradually moving away from the  earth.

Among more current research being conducted at Lick  Observatory is the recent effort by astronomers to detect planets  outside our solar system. This headline-making work, using the  facility's 120-inch Shane Telescope, is being led by astronomers  Geoffrey Marcy and Paul Butler. Marcy, who earned his Ph.D. at  UCSC, uses an exquisitely sensitive tool designed by his former  adviser, UCSC astronomer Steven Vogt. The instrument, called the  Hamilton Spectrograph, unveils tiny "wobbles" in the motions of  stars across the sky--hints of the gravitational tuggings of unseen  planets.
