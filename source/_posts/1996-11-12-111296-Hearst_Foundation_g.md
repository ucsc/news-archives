SANTA CRUZ, CA--A $50,000 grant from the William Randolph Hearst  Foundation of San Francisco will strengthen public education programs at  the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory, a research and education facility  operated by UC Santa Cruz.

The grant will allow educators to augment "Windows to Discovery," the  popular program that debuted at Long Marine Lab in 1994. Windows to  Discovery serves as a model education program in the ocean sciences,  emphasizing the unique environment of the Monterey Bay National Marine  Sanctuary. The program promotes public awareness, encourages students to  learn about conservation and pursue careers in marine science, and provides  K-12 teachers in the region with training and curricular materials.

"The support of the Hearst Foundation will allow us to sustain our  current programs and expand several pilot programs into full components of  Windows to Discovery," says Dorris Welch, public education director at Long  Marine Lab. The grant also builds a firmer foundation for programs  envisioned for the lab's planned $4.4 million Visitor Education Center, Welch  adds.

Funding from the Hearst Foundation will benefit the following areas:

\-- Outreach to K-8 students. Long Marine Lab educators will offer a  program throughout the academic year that provides hands-on instruction in  marine science at regional elementary and middle schools, which often  cannot send students on field trips to the lab.

\-- Interpretive training programs. To strengthen their dedicated group  of about 150 volunteer docents, educators will pair experienced docents  with trainees in a new mentoring program. Further, twenty student interns  from UCSC's degree programs in marine biology and environmental studies  will join the annual docent training course, adding fresh perspectives and  enthusiasm.

\-- A multimedia exhibit. The grant will provide permanent equipment  for the lab's interactive computer exhibit, "Bay Window," which leads  students through the steps of scientific inquiry.

Named for publisher and philanthropist William Randolph Hearst, the  Hearst Foundation funds programs in education, health, human services, and  culture. It focuses on institutions that provide access and opportunity to  underrepresented, low-income, and minority populations.
