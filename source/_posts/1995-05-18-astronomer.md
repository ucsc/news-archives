SANTA CRUZ, CA--Interviews with a distinguished astronomer and  former director of Lick Observatory have been published by the  Regional History Project of the University Library at the University  of California, Santa Cruz. In the publication, titled A. E. Whitford:  Directorship of Lick Observatory, 1958-1968, Albert Whitford  discusses his experiences as director of the country's oldest  mountaintop research observatory.

Whitford took on the directorship of the observatory during a  time of momentous change. As director, he navigated the observatory  through two significant events: the final installation of the 120- inch Shane Telescope and in 1966 after nearly 80 years as an  independent operation, the incorporation of the observatory into the  new UC Santa Cruz campus.

The oral history is the result of a series of interviews  conducted by Randall Jarrell, documentary historian and head of the  Regional History Project. It is being published as part of the  project's Lick Observatory History series.

Now an astronomer emeritus of UCSC, Whitford was the first  director ever selected by the observatory's astronomers. They  viewed Whitford as the best person to push ahead the stalled  completion of the 120-inch Shane Telescope. The project had met  with cost overruns and numerous delays, many because of technical  difficulties. A highly respected instrument specialist, Whitford  explains in the history that, "My reputation as a person who could  handle instruments, perfect them and get them to work, was  something that [Lick astronomers] felt they needed." In 1959, just  under a year after Whitford's directorship began, the Shane  Telescope went into operation. For the next fifteen years the Shane  remained the second-largest telescope in the world.

The advanced instrument was soon in high demand by  astronomers in residence at the observatory as well as those at  other campuses. Whitford recounts some of the complicated  diplomacy and juggling of schedules the popular telescope  necessitated.

An interesting element of the oral history is Whitford's  insider's perspective on the observatory's changeover from an  autonomous entity to that of an affiliate of the Santa Cruz campus.  He shares his observations of the friction within the observatory  staff and among the staff and outside astronomers and UCSC  administrators holding conflicting views on the research mission of  the observatory.

Other topics addressed in the history include Whitford's early  experiences in astronomy and his background in astronomical  research, his contributions to the development of photoelectric  technology for observing stars and nebulae, and some history of  twentieth-century astronomy. Whitford also shares his perspective  on the effect on the observatory of administrative changes initiated  by UC President Clark Kerr, who began his tenure at the same time  as Whitford.

Whitford also recalls some personal aspects of his tenure,  such as the experiences of his wife and family at Lick and the  character of life in the isolated residential observatory on Mount  Hamilton. In a characteristically frank reflection, Whitford also  discusses his decision to resign from his post in 1968.

The volume includes an introduction, table of contents, index,  and frontispiece photograph. Indexed photocopies can be purchased at  cost for deposit (on a noncirculating basis) in research collections  and libraries. A. E. Whitford: Directorship of Lick Observatory,  1958-1968, is currently available in Special Collections, McHenry  Library, UCSC, and at The Bancroft Library, UC Berkeley.
