Recruitments have opened for two senior administrative positions  at UCSC: executive vice chancellor and vice chancellor for university relations. Both recruitments are national in scope, and members of the campus community are encouraged to participate in the searches by identifying and nominating qualified candidates.

The EVC recruitment follows Michael Tanner's announcement earlier this year that he would step down at the end of June. The successful candidate in this search will have strong academic and administrative experience. "Obviously, the person who fills this position will be a key player on the campus's administrative team," Chancellor Greenwood said. "Our enrollment is once again on the rise, and it is critical that we continue the work of preparing and planning for UCSC's future. We are seeking outstanding individuals who are attracted to this challenge."

Enthusiasm, experience, and fund-raising success are among the characteristics sought for the position of vice chancellor for university relations. "With major new initiatives under way or in the works in every division, the campus will benefit enormously from increased attention to all aspects of university relations, including development, alumni affairs, and governmental and public relations," said the chancellor.

The review of candidates for both positions is expected to begin by mid-January. Nominations and applications will be considered until the positions are filled. Questions may be directed to Dr. Leslie Sunell in the Chancellor's Office.
