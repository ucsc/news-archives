University Police sergeant **Nancy Carroll** graduated September 12 from the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia. The 11-week academy offers advanced investigative, management, and fitness training to upper- and mid-level law enforcement managers around the world. It also provides an opportunity for the officers to share ideas, techniques, and experiences. Carroll joined UC Santa Cruz as a police officer in 1984 after working for the UCLA and city of San Jose police departments. She was promoted to sergeant in 1989.

![Officer Mike Kimura][2]

University Police officer **Mike Kimura** was awarded the UC Police Distinguished Service Medal for Conspicuous Bravery in the Line of Duty at a ceremony on campus September 24 . Off-duty and with no safety equipment at his disposal, Officer Kimura stopped to assist a woman who was being violently attacked and strangled by a man. He was able to free the woman, throw the man's knife out of reach, and subdue the highly agitated and out-of-control suspect until other officers could arrive. The Santa Cruz Police officer investigating the case said the man was strangling the woman in such a violent way that in his opinion Officer Kimura had "definitely saved the woman's life." Officer Kimura is the first police officer at UCSC to receive the systemwide award.

University Police sergeant **Jeff Powell** has completed the Supervisory Leadership Institute sponsored by the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training. The training program involved 192 hours of classes over an eight-month period.
