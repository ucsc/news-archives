SANTA CRUZ, CA--Planners at the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory  of the University of California, Santa Cruz, have moved $300,000  closer to their goal of a new Visitor Education Center, with the  receipt of a $200,000 grant from the David and Lucile Packard  Foundation of Los Altos and a $100,000 unitrust established by Paul  and Anne Irwin of Watsonville.

To date, donors and foundations have committed about $2  million to the center, which will improve the lab's education  programs for schoolchildren and the general public. The 12,000- square-foot facility will cost about $4.4 million for construction  and exhibitions. Aside from $500,000 in state money for a teaching  lab in part of the complex, private support will provide most funds.

"We are encouraged that our supporters continue to recognize  the value of investing in the excellent education programs at Long  Marine Laboratory," says Daniel Aldrich, assistant chancellor for  University Advancement at UCSC. "The lab already plays a key role in  informing the public about the importance of understanding the  marine environment. The Visitor Education Center will dramatically  enhance that role."

The Packard Foundation is a driving force behind the  burgeoning education and research programs in the area, with its  financing of the Monterey Bay Aquarium and its affiliated research  institute. The foundation was created in 1964 to support and  encourage organizations that depend on private funding and volunteer  leadership. It makes grants for programs in the arts, community,  marine biology, environment, population, education, and children's  health.

Paul Irwin recently joined the Board of Trustees of the UC  Santa Cruz Foundation, a nonprofit, public benefit corporation that  promotes understanding and support of campus programs. Irwin is a  retired senior executive of the McCormick Company. Both he and his  wife Anne are excited by the development of Long Marine Lab, says  Aldrich, and wished to help realize the new center. The unitrust is a  deferred gift that permits UCSC to invest the funds on behalf of the  Irwins.

The Visitor Education Center is one part of extensive growth  planned for the next several years at Long Marine Lab. Other new  buildings will include headquarters for the Branch of Pacific Marine  Geology of the U.S. Geological Survey, labs for the National Marine  Fisheries Service, and a California Department of Fish and Game  facility to rescue and rehabilitate oiled wildlife.
