SANTA CRUZ, CA--A 1990 film by the late Argentine director Maria  Luisa Bemberg kicks off a public film festival at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, that celebrates the first 100 years of cinema  with a focus on depictions of gender in Latin American films.

The festival, which runs June 25-29, features seven films,  five of which have never before been shown in Santa Cruz. The event  brings together an unprecedented sample of works by Latin American  women directors, spanning the entire seven decades of sound film  production. Screenings will begin at 7:30 p.m. in Oakes 105 at UCSC.  Unless otherwise noted, all works are in Spanish with English  subtitles. A $3 donation is requested.

In her film I, the Last Woman of All, Bemberg tells the story of  Sister Juana Ines de la Cruz, a seventeenth-century Mexican nun  considered the most brilliant woman of her age. The film is based on  the Nobel prize-winning author Octavio Paz's historical biography  The Traps of Faith. "Bemberg is the most important woman  filmmaker in Latin American history and the most prolific Latin  American director of the last decade. She had a meteoric career,"  says festival organizer Julianne Burton-Carvajal, a professor of  Spanish literature and coordinator of the Latin American and Latino  studies program at UCSC. "She made her first film at the age of 59  and completed six features before her death at 73." Bemberg died  May 7. Burton-Carvajal calls I, the Last Woman of All Bemberg's  "most artistically daring film."

"She chose to shoot the entire film in a studio," says Burton- Carvajal. "Even the outdoor scenes were created. It's a very unusual  choice in this day and age, and she did it deliberately because the  film is about living under repression. She uses the set design as a  functional part of the film. It's an ambitious approach to telling the  story of the most important woman in Latin American history."

The festival is presented as part of the Cine-Siglo (Cinema- Century) Conference, a working conference focusing on women  directors and cinematic depictions of gender. The conference, which  will be held at UCSC's Merrill College June 25-July 1, will bring  together faculty, graduate students, and independent researchers  from across the United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, and  Brazil. The conference is being sponsored by the Humanities  Division, the Center for Cultural Studies, UC Mexus (a binational  consortium), and the UC Office of the President.

The film festival schedule follows. For more information, call  (408) 459-4560.
