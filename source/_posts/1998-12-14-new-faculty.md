**Manu Goswami:** Assistant Professor of Politics

An assistant professor of politics, Manu Goswami comes to UCSC from the University of Chicago, where she wrote her dissertation on the historical origins of Indian nationalism. Her research integrates recent developments in the study of nationalism, political economy, and social theory to rethink the dynamic between colonialism and anticolonial nationalism. Goswami's work is motivated by an interest in the roots of India's contemporary conflict between Hindus and Muslims. She is currently working on a book manuscript entitled, "The Production of India: Colonialism, Nationalism, and Territorial Nativism, 1870-1948."
