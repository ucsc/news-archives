SANTA CRUZ, CA--A $50,000 gift from the J. M. Long Foundation to  the University Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz,  will be used to update and expand the library's collection of Pacific  Rim materials. With the expansion, the UCSC Library collection will  offer an outstanding resource to faculty, students, and the local  community in a burgeoning field of study.

Over the past decade the Pacific Rim has drawn the attention  of scholars in such diverse disciplines as economics, environmental  studies, and theater arts. The region­comprising countries ringing  the Pacific Ocean from the U.S. to China and Canada to New Guinea­ has evolved into an interdependent region through such forces as  immigration, economic trade, cultural exchange, and shared  environmental concerns.

"Geopolitical changes in the '80s have shifted the focus of  scholars from more narrowly defined areas of studies to an  emphasis on the Pacific Rim as a whole," explains University  Librarian Allan Dyson. "With the help of the J. M. Long Foundation, the  library can provide UCSC students and faculty with the print and  electronic information resources they need to understand the  diverse cultures and economies of the Pacific Rim and to appreciate  their unique impact upon the citizens of California. UCSC's Pacific  Rim collection can serve as a primary resource for researchers and  community members from the entire central California coast."

The proceeds from the endowment will make possible the  permanent purchase of an estimated 50 serial publications,  including many requested by faculty researchers; newspapers in  vernacular languages; other regional newspapers and newsletters;  publications from private organizations; selected foreign and  international documents; transcripts of conference proceedings;  economic working papers; and electronic journals.

The J. M. Long Foundation is a charitable organization founded  in 1966 by Joseph M. Long, the late co-founder of Longs Drug Stores.  The foundation provides grants for organizations involved in health  care, medical research, education, wildlife conservation, and land  preservation.

The foundation has a long history of providing support to UCSC.  In 1978, the campus opened the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory­a  research facility funded by the Long Foundation. The foundation's  support of the University Library dates back to the campus's early  years when founding chancellor Dean McHenry and Joseph Long  discovered a shared interest in the Pacific region. Their farsighted  interest led to the establishment of the original Pacific Rim  collection (then called the South Pacific collection) between 1970  and 1972.

At UCSC, more than two dozen faculty are actively engaged in  Pacific Rim studies in disciplines including history, art history,  medical anthropology, international economics, ethnomusicology,  theater, literature, politics, ecology, and colonial studies.
