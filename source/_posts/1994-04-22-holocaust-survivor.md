SANTA CRUZ, CA--Renee Firestone survived Auschwitz. For 50 years  she has remembered the final words of those who did not. "The last  words when someone was taken away were always 'Remember us if  you survive,'" says Firestone, who was eighteen years old when she  was imprisoned.

On Wednesday, May 11, at 8 p.m., Firestone will give a free  public talk in the Kresge Town Hall at UC Santa Cruz. Her talk is  titled "Where Have All These Faces Gone: A Holocaust Survivor's  Perspective on the Patterns of Racism and Resistance." She will also  attend a brown-bag lunch on Thursday, May 12, from 11:30 a.m. to 1  p.m. at the UCSC Women's Center, and the publis is invited.

For the last seventeen years, Firestone, 70, has worked with  the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Educational Outreach Program in Los  Angeles, telling her story to schoolchildren, church groups, and other  organizations around the country. "Seventeen years ago, people  considered it a Jewish problem and couldn't understand why we'd  want to teach about the Holocaust to non-Jewish children," says  Firestone. "Today there is much greater awareness and people  realize what a human problem this was." Firestone was involved  earlier this year with the court-mandated counseling of a dozen  young members of the Fourth Reich Skinheads of Orange County, who  were plotting to start a race war against Jews, blacks, and other  ethnic minorities when federal agents intervened.

Firestone is struck by the sensitivity of the young people she  meets today. "Junior high school and high school students are much  more compassionate and understanding of their fellow man than the  previous generation was," she says. "They're asking very personal  questions. They're not just asking for facts. They really want to feel.  It's a very good sign. I have very great hopes for the future  generation.

"I tell them they're the last generation that will hear from  survivors personally, and it will be their responsibility to tell  others," says Firestone, who was born in Czechoslovakia. She and her  14-year-old sister and parents were taken to Auschwitz. "We had no  idea about the extermination camps. No idea," she says. "It was the greatest mystery to me, why we were  there and what was happening."

The girls were separated from their parents upon arrival, and  Firestone asked a guard when they would be reunited. The guard,  pointing to the chimney of a crematorium, told Firestone: "There go  your parents through that chimney, and when you go through it, you'll  be reunited with them."

Firestone's mother and sister were murdered; her father died  from tuberculosis shortly after liberation. Firestone emigrated to  the United States in 1948 with her husband and infant daughter.  People didn't want to hear about the Holocaust after the war, says  Firestone. "People didn't believe us. I don't blame them--maybe I  wouldn't have believed it, either. We had to start a new life, we had  to start new families."

A retired fashion designer, Firestone lives with her husband in  Beverly Hills. They have one adult daughter and a granddaughter.

The campus sponsors of Firestone's visit are Kresge College,  the Center for Cultural Studies, and the Boards of Studies in  Community Studies, Women's Studies, and American Studies. For  more information about the events, call the Public Information  Office at (408) 459-2495.
