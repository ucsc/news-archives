To My Campus Colleagues:

You may be aware of recent news reports describing the 1998 admissions statistics for the University of California, especially in regard to the serious decline of admissions of Chicano/Latino, African American and other underrepresented students at some of the other UC campuses. Presented in the context of SP-1 and Proposition 209, these stories are potentially detrimental to the University of California's goal of reflecting the state's diversity among UC students. Given this situation, it is especially important for us at UC Santa Cruz to be aware of our particular admissions status--and to do everything we can to emphasize the good news about UCSC's admissions figures, while making every effort to encourage students we have admitted to enroll here in the fall.

Toward that end, I am very proud to note that UC Santa Cruz received a record number of applications, and from that impressive pool, we have sent letters of admission to one of the most diverse and most highly qualified classes in recent years. With such rich potential for our entering class next fall, it is essential for each member of the campus to join the effort to encourage these outstanding students to select UCSC and to complete the enrollment process.

Specifically, among UC-eligible students admitted for fall 1998, there is an 8.4 percent increase overall in the number of underrepresented students, or a total of 148. And at the same time, the average GPA is 3.62, while the average SAT score is 1165. You will find specific data about admissions by ethnicity in the April 6-13 issue of Currents Online.

This excellent pool of potential "Banana Slugs" will be eagerly sought--especially those highly qualified students of color--by other campuses that also have admitted them. UC Santa Cruz, led by the Admissions Office and joined by faculty, staff and students from throughout the campus, is using creative means to reach out to these students and to provide them with the information they need to make their final selection.

Here are a few of the "yield" activities, with ideas for ways that each of us can be involved:
* Campus tours--this is the time of year when many prospective students and their families are visiting the campus, and we all have the opportunity to make them feel welcome. For example, if you see visitors in passing, greet them, and, if they appear to need directions, please take a moment to assist them.
* Banana Slug Spring Fair--set for April 18, this annual "open house" is an opportunity to showcase our academic programs and our distinguished faculty, as well as demonstrate some of the other advantages of enrolling at UCSC. To their credit, there are literally hundreds of faculty, staff and students already involved in planning and presenting this event. If you want to help, please contact Rachel Strauss in Admissions at (408) 459-5389 or Marina Malikoff in the Alumni Office at (408) 459-3058.
* Individual outreach--perhaps the most effective way to underscore a sincere welcome to prospective students is by direct one-on-one contact with them. For example, a call from a faculty member to say, "I'd like to have you join us at UCSC," is one of the most powerful messages we could possibly send. I have personally placed some of those calls, and I will continue to do so. As well, our potential students are receiving letters of welcome from the deans, students are volunteering to call and to visit prospective colleagues, and many students, through student organizations, have initiated creative outreach efforts such as planning overnight stays for interested applicants. In addition, many of our alumni are reaching out through calls, visits and letters to encourage enrollment at UCSC. If you are available to help with these contacts, please call Rachel Strauss.

Much appreciation is due to these faculty, students, staff and alumni--and I want to thank personally all of those who gave, or continue to give, so generously of their time.

In summary, we have a lot to be proud of at UCSC--and we all can participate in the effort to make prospective students and their families aware of the advantages of joining us.
