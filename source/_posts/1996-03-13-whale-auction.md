SANTA CRUZ, CA--Whales abound in Santa Cruz. There are migrating  gray whales, the Nuclear Whales Saxophone Orchestra, and the most  fun-filled whale of all: "A Whale of an Auction," the largest annual  fund-raising event for public education programs at Long Marine  Laboratory.

This year's soiree, the eleventh annual auction, begins at 6 p.m.  Friday, March 29, in the Porter College Dining Hall at UC Santa Cruz.  About 400 people usually attend the auction, which raises tens of  thousands of dollars for the lab's efforts to inform schoolchildren  and the general public about our unique place on the central coast.

The evening will include an hors-d'oeuvres buffet from  Michael's Catering, champagne and caviar from the docents and  Friends of Long Marine Lab, and both silent and live auctions. The  Redwood String Quartet will provide live music.

Items up for bid will include a beach clambake for twenty at  the Crow's Nest; golf for four at the Olympic Club in San Francisco; a  behind-the-scenes tour at Monterey Bay Aquarium's new wing; a  time-share in Acapulco; retreats in Big Sur; a one-week stay at the  San Juan Islands in Washington; a private Monterey Bay charter  aboard the Chardonnay; a private flight at Altamont Pass to view  golden eagles; tickets to sporting events; meals at fine restaurants;  pottery and other artworks; and jewelry, wines, and scores of other  gifts. Bob Slawinski of the Slawinski Auction Company will oversee  the festivities.

Proceeds help thousands of schoolchildren and visitors to Long  Marine Lab learn about the Monterey Bay marine environment and  marine research at UCSC through the "Window to Discovery" and  other programs. The Friends of Long Marine Lab, sponsor of the  auction, also is raising funds for a new Visitor Education Center at  the lab.

Tickets are $30 in advance or $35 at the door. For  reservations, call Long Marine Lab at 459-2883.

Donations to the auction or to the lab's education programs are  welcome. For more information, call Lisa M. Rose at 459-3694.
