SANTA CRUZ, CA--On October 28 several San Francisco community  organizations will host an event celebrating the publication of a new  book on the history of Chinese American women in San Francisco.  The event will also honor three women's organizations and several  of the women who play a central role in the book, titled Unbound  Feet: A Social History of Chinese Women in San Francisco (Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1995).

Judy Yung, the book's author and an assistant professor of  American studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will  present a slide show in English and Chinese on Chinese women's  history, followed by a tribute to the women she writes about in her  book who will be in attendance. The event is sponsored by the  University of California Press, the Chinese Cultural Foundation of  San Francisco, and the Chinese Historical Society of America. The  gathering, which is free and open to the public, runs from 1 to 4 p.m.  on October 28 in the Chinese Cultural Center, 750 Kearny St., Third  Floor, San Francisco. A reception and book signing will follow the  presentation.

Yung is the daughter of Chinese immigrants herself, and her  mother's story of life as a factory worker and mother of six children  is one of the many in Yung's book. The names and biographies of some  of the women who will attend the book party are listed below, as are  the names of some organizations that were key in supporting  Chinese American women in San Francisco.

For more information, the public may call the Chinese Cultural  Center at (415) 986-1822.

For review copies of the book, contact Estrella Fichter at UC  Press at (510) 642-4701.

**Profiles of Honorees at October 28 Book Party for Unbound Feet**

Sue Ko Lee: Lee, 87, came to the U.S. when she was eight years old.  She became active in labor organizing in 1938 while working as a  buttonhole machine operator in a sewing factory. She participated in  a 105-day strike against the factory and in the formation of the  Chinese Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. She went on to serve as  secretary for her local union and for the International Ladies'  Garment Workers' Union, working to improve conditions for Chinese  seamstresses.

Law Shee Low: Low, 92, immigrated to the U.S. as a young bride in  1922\. She took in sewing at home and then later went to work in a  factory while raising eight children in a crowded tenement  apartment. Low's story is typical of many women immigrating before  World War II who worked in garment factories to keep their families  financially solvent.

Eva Lowe: Lowe, 86, was born in the U.S. and raised in Fort Bragg,  Calif. As a young adult, she was inspired by Chinese nationalism to  become politically active. She joined the Chinese Students  Association in San Francisco and made "soapbox" speeches in  Chinatown condemning Japanese aggression in China. During the  Great Depression she helped needy families apply for government  relief. She was also active in the labor movement. For many years  she volunteered for several San Francisco public service  organizations.

Jade Snow Wong: Wong, 73, was born in San Francisco. The first  Chinese American woman to achieve a successful career in ceramics  and writing while raising a family of four children, she is the author  of Fifth Chinese Daughter (New York: Harper & Row, 1965 and 1950;  and, third edition, Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1989),  and No Chinese Stranger (New York: Harper & Row, 1975). She still  operates a ceramics store and travel business in San Francisco and  volunteers for several public service organizations.

Jesse Lee Yip: Yip, 70, was born in the U.S. She is one of the few  Chinese women in San Francisco who served in the Women's Army  Corps during World War II. Following the war she worked for 30  years as a secretary at the San Francisco Juvenile Hall. She  currently volunteers for a number of Chinese public service  organizations in San Francisco.

Alice Fong Yu: Yu, 90, was born in the U.S. In 1926 she became the  first Chinese schoolteacher to be hired by the San Francisco school  district. She also helped found the Square and Circle Club, the  Chinese chapter of the Needlework Guild, and the Lake Tahoe Chinese  Christian Conference. She was also active in the Chinese YWCA and  the Chinese Historical Society of America. During World War II she  coordinated a number of fashion shows as fund-raisers for the war  effort and spearheaded a boycott of silk stockings.

Law Ying Yung: Yung, 82, is the author's mother. She immigrated to  the U.S. in 1941 to join her husband. She worked in the Chinatown  sewing factories while raising six children. Like many women of her  generation, Yung came to the U.S. expecting to find a land of plenty  and opportunity and instead labored for most of her life in a  Chinatown sweatshop while raising a large family.

The Donaldina Cameron House: Established in 1874 as a shelter for  Chinese women trying to escape a life of indentured prostitution,  the organization is still active today, focusing its efforts on  assisting Chinese American youths and battered women.

Chinese YWCA: Established in 1916, the Chinese Y provided Chinese  American women with English classes, translation services, social  activities, and help with employment, immigration, and domestic  problems. Renamed the YWCA Clay Street Center in 1947, the  organization still provides educational opportunities and social  services to the community at large.

Square and Circle Club: Founded in 1924, the name of the  organization comes from the Chinese coin and motto, "In deeds be  square, in knowledge be all-around." The club engages in fund-raising  for charity projects and community causes and advocacy for  improving the conditions of Chinese Americans.
