**National Center Based At UCSC Will Address Primary Risk Factors Of  Language, Race, Poverty, And Geographic Location Facing Students  From Preschool Through College**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California, Santa Cruz, has been  selected by the federal Department of Education to coordinate a  five-year, $20 million effort designed to help students whose  education is at risk.

The project will bring together researchers from around the  country to focus on four risk factors that jeopardize the success of  students: limited English proficiency, race, poverty, and geographic  location.

Students who face one or more of these factors are at great  risk of not finishing their education or of not reaching their full  potential, says Roland Tharp, professor of education at UCSC and  director of the new center. The goals of the project, which will  reach from preschool through college, will be to identify the most  effective strategies for helping at-risk students and to influence  policy from the local to the national level, he says.

"We will bring together major researchers from around the  country to establish the scope of the problem and to develop  practical policy solutions that will be ready for enactment," says  Tharp. "We know the problem is pervasive and that it requires a  coordinated national effort to deal with it. Our job will be to find  out what can be done to respond to the challenges education is  facing today."

UCSC's selection marks the second time in six years that the  campus has been chosen as the site of a federally funded national  center for education. The National Center for Research on Cultural  Diversity and Second Language Learning was established at UCSC in  1991 to develop effective educational strategies for students with  limited English skills. That five-year project was completed last  year.

"This new project recognizes the campus's national leadership  on issues of language and culture, and it enables us to expand those  interests to include the issues of race, poverty, and geography that  are hobbling our educational system," says Tharp.

The exact scope of the problem is not known, in part because  studies have not looked at the number of students facing more than  one risk factor, says Tharp. Generally, in a class of 30 students,  educators figure that 10 students are either second-language  learners, immigrants, or minorities, and 10 students suffer from  poverty. "But they may not be the same 10 children," points out  Tharp. "Not every poor child is at risk, and not every ethnic minority  is at risk."

Geographic location plays a large role in determining a  student's educational opportunities, notes Tharp, adding that the  project will cover issues facing inner-city students as well as  those in Appalachia and other remote rural locations, including  Indian reservations. Researchers will be working with inner-city  students in San Francisco, San Diego, Boston, Washington, D.C.,  Memphis, and Miami.

"Research projects will be active at each level--from  individual classrooms, schools, and districts, to state, national, and  tribal policy," says Tharp.

UCSC will serve as the lead campus and fiscal agent that  administers what is called a "cooperative agreement." The work will  be done under contract with the Department of Education, and the  contract will be renegotiated each year, explains Tharp.

In addition to UCSC, other schools and facilities participating  in the center, which has yet to be named, are: The Center for Applied  Linguistics; University of Colorado, Boulder; Brown University;  George Mason University; University of Arizona; California State  University, Long Beach; California State University, San Jose;  University of Hawaii; ARC; RAND; TERC; Johns Hopkins University;  University of Houston; University of Louisville; Western Washington  University; California State University, San Diego; University of  Memphis; University of Southern California; and Claremont Graduate  School. In addition, University of California campuses in Davis, Los  Angeles, San Diego, and Santa Barbara will participate under the  auspices of UC's systemwide Language Minority Research Institute.

Participants will embark on 38 research projects in program  areas that include language learning, professional development,  family/peers/community, instruction in context, and integrated  reform. Eight projects will be based at UCSC. In addition to Tharp,  UCSC participants will include Margarita Azmitia, Maureen Callanan,  Catherine Cooper, Stephanie Dalton, Peggy Estrada, Barbara Rogoff,  and Trish Stoddart.

Among the 38 projects that have been funded are:

* A study that will identify the most successful training  programs for teachers who work with at-risk students.

* An examination of ways in which business and industry can  best team up with schools for positive change.

* A project to identify the particular struggles of gifted  minority girls.

Independent researchers will be in continuous communication  with others in similar fields, and annual conferences will bring  together all the participants, says Tharp. "We will also be in close  touch with the Department of Education, and we want to be  informing national policy as we go along," he says.
