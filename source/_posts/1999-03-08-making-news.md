In an op-ed published in the _Los Angeles Times,_ **Susanne Jonas** of Latin American and Latino studies called on President Clinton to apologize for the U.S. role in Guatemala's civil war.

It's not every day that the _Wall Street Journal_ reviews west coast theater, much less UCSC theater. But the reporter who wrote the story was drawn in by the play's enduring themes of love, immortality, and . . . computers. The play, _On the Other Side of the World,_ was written by local artist Erik Fogelberg and theater arts graduate student **Sol Crawford,** who also directed. The play is based on the Greek myth of Orpheus who was represented in this version by a man of mythological proportions himself, Bill Gates. Playing opposite him as the love of his life (and death) was the revolutionary new computer, Eurydice 2000.

**Anita Diaz **of Student Health Services was interviewed by Romney Dunbar of KION-TV for a story about body image and eating disorders.

A talk sponsored by the **Women's Center** about sex trafficking of young girls attracted the attention of KCBS Radio and _Metro Santa Cruz._
