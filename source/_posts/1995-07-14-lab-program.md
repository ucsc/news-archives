SANTA CRUZ, CA--Children in recreation programs and day camps are  invited to attend a special summer offering at the Long Marine Lab in  Santa Cruz: a fun two-hour educational program aimed at children in  grades K-5. The program, designed for groups of 10 to 30 children,  will occur on Fridays from 10 a.m. to 12 noon, August 4 through  September 1.

Led by experienced educators, children will explore their  marine environment by viewing the lab's dolphins and other research  animals, dipping their hands in touch tanks, looking through  microscopes, and examining pelts, fossils, and shells. Artistic  exercises and active games will help the children enjoy and  understand what they see. Depending on their ages, participants may  learn about kelp forests, marine conservation, the ecology and  biology of marine mammals, or the natural history of the Monterey  Bay region.

Because space is limited, group leaders should make  reservations well in advance. To cover expenses, there is a fee of  $25 for groups with 10 to 15 children and $40 for groups of 16 to  30\. For a reservation or more information, call the Long Marine Lab's  public education office at 459-3854.

The Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory is a coastal marine- research station and educational facility operated by the University  of California, Santa Cruz.
