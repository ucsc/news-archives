**April 22 Talk On Harrison's Music And Politics Is One Of Several Ucsc Events Honoring The Composer**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Musicologist and flutist Leta Miller will present an  inaugural lecture titled "Sounding Off: Lou Harrison's Musical Politics" at 8  P.M. Tuesday, April 22, in the Music Center at the University of California,  Santa Cruz. The talk is part of the campuswide celebration of Harrison's  80th birthday that also includes a concert and art exhibit (see below). The  lecture is free and open to the public.

Miller and colleague Fredric Lieberman, both professors of music at  UCSC, have just completed a book for Oxford University Press on the world- renowned composer, who is a resident of Santa Cruz County. Their book,  tentatively titled "Lou Harrison: Composing a World," will be released later  this year by Oxford University Press. Miller is also featured on four  recordings of the music of Lou Harrison.

Miller's talk draws from a chapter in the forthcoming book and will  incorporate musical samples, slides, and excerpts from interviews with  Harrison and his colleagues.

"Lou has never separated politics from his music," Miller said. "He's  written multiple compositions since 1930s and as recently as 1991  expressing his political ideals." Miller describes some of Harrison's  politically oriented work, which began in the 1930s when he wrote a series  of political pieces designed for modern dance. The first, "Waterfront 1934,"  was a pro-union composition concerning the San Francisco general strike. It  premiered at the Longshoreman's San Francisco headquarters in a boxing  ring, Miller said. Harrison's politically oriented work also includes "Peace  Pieces" he wrote during the Vietnam War and "Homage to Pacifica,"  composed in 1991.

Miller and Lieberman's work on the book has received support from two  NEH grants totaling more than $55,000. The book begins with an extended  biography followed by a series of topical chapters, including "music and the  dance," "tuning and temperament," "instruments and instrument building,"  "music and politics," "music and sexuality," and "compositional process."  Also included is a detailed catalogue of works, listing more than 300 items.  The authors conducted interviews with Harrison over a period of a year-and- a-half and also interviewed more than 50 people around the country  associated with Harrison over the past half century.

Harrison is regarded as one of the world's foremost living composers,  recognized for his work in the areas of percussion, experiments with  intonation systems, and the synthesis of Western and Asian musical styles.  He is a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the  recipient of two Guggenheim awards, two Rockefeller grants, and a Fulbright  award. In addition to his musical compositions, Harrison has authored and  published prose and poetry, and his paintings have been displayed in a  number of public exhibitions. His calligraphy is renowned and Harrison has  even designed several computer fonts.

Inaugural Lectures are presented to celebrate a UCSC faculty member's  promotion or appointment to the position of full professor. The lectures are  presented by UCSC Arts & Lectures and supported by the Offices of the  Chancellor and Executive Vice Chancellor, the Council of Provosts, and  University Affiliates.
