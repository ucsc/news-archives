SANTA CRUZ, CA--In conjunction with graduation, several colleges  at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are honoring  "inspirational K-12 teachers" nominated by graduating seniors. The  following advisory details how participating colleges are  recognizing teachers who inspired their students to pursue a  university education.

Crown College: Crown College is honoring Gary Cramton, a teacher at  The Ark School in Santa Cruz, who was nominated by Franklin  Williams, a Crown graduating senior. Franklin is a re-entry student  who was greatly influenced by Cramton through the Youths  Experiencing Success (YES) program. Cramton will attend the Crown  graduation at 10 a.m. in the Upper Quarry Amphitheater on Sunday,  June 16, where he will be publicly recognized.

Oakes College: Following a tradition begun several years ago, Oakes  College graduates nominated their favorite K-12 teacher for  recognition, and the college provost has sent letters to the teachers,  including the student's tributes. Copies of both were also sent to the  school principal and superintendent. This year, for the first time,  teachers' names will be listed in the commencement program.
