The next Executive Vice Chancellor for UC Santa Cruz brings extensive  successful experience in academic administration, a distinguished  background in psychology--and a lifelong affiliation with the University of  California. Dr. John B. Simpson will assume the position as of July 1. Currently  the Dean of Arts and Sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, he  was selected following a national search to replace Dr. R. Michael Tanner,  who has served in the position for more than nine years.

"We are delighted that John has accepted the invitation to join us,"  noted Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "He has demonstrated exceptional  leadership in his present post, and we are excited by the addition of his  energy and considerable talents to the UCSC team."

Speaking from his office in Seattle, Simpson expressed great  enthusiasm for his upcoming appointment. "UC Santa Cruz is at the threshold  of a very exciting period, with new opportunities for programmatic  expansion. On a professional level, meeting the challenges of that kind of  institution building--and especially, enjoying the privilege to work with such  a dynamic and visionary chancellor--are powerful attractors. And on a  personal level, my family and I are University of California alums. It is truly  exciting to be back in the system...it's coming home."

Simpson leaves the University of Washington after a 23-year career  that began in 1975 with his appointment as Assistant Professor of  Psychology. He was appointed as Professor of Psychology in 1982, and since  that time he has held various faculty and administrative positions, including  service as Director of the Joint Physiology-Psychology Program, Head of the  Behavioral Neuroscience Area, and Associate Dean for Computing, Facilities  and Research, in the College of Arts and Sciences. He has served as Dean of  the College of Arts and Sciences since 1995. Encompassing 42 departments or  schools, as well as two museums and the performing center, the College of  Arts and Sciences embraces four divisions with 900 faculty and 22,000  students.

UCSC's gain is a keenly felt loss for Simpson's colleagues at the  University of Washington. Robin McCabe, Director of the School of Music, said,  "We will mourn his departure. We have to be happy for him, and for Santa  Cruz--but we will miss him." She added, "He has been a wonderful advocate;  for example, in extremely lean times, he has been a very creative strategist  in making bold proposals to increase the profile of the arts at the University  of Washington."

This sentiment was echoed many times by faculty and administrators  representative of the full spectrum of disciplines within the College of Arts  and Sciences. Michael Halleran, Divisional Dean of the Arts and Humanities  and former Chair of the Classics Department, noted, "John's great strength,  simply put, is that he is a good leader. He is intellectually curious, knows how  both to listen and to make decisions--and he's an awfully nice guy."

English Department Chair Shawn Wong emphasized that "no one works  as hard or accepts more responsibility than John. He's been entirely  supportive and encouraging--the best dean I've ever worked with. He'll be a  fabulous executive vice chancellor." Another colleague and Chair of  American Ethnic Studies, Ana Mari Cauce, noted, "What I will always most  associate with John is a tremendous personal warmth, integrity, and decency.  He is someone that really cares, both about education and about the people  that go into making an educational institution work, whether they be staff,  faculty, or administrative colleagues. He goes out of his way to make himself  accessible and he listens. I can't begin to express how much he will be  missed."

More than a scholar and an able administrator, Simpson has been a  leader in ensuring diversity at the University of Washington, both in  academic programming and among those he has hired. Cauce continues, "It's  hard to think of one major accomplishment that John made to UW. Some  would undoubtedly say it was the founding of the Humanities Center; others  might point to the new Neurobiology major. I immediately think of the  ethnic and gender diversity that he brought to his administrative team and  Chair appointments." Overall, I think his key accomplishment was keeping  the Arts and Sciences not only vital, but at the heart of the University of  Washington during a time when there is growing emphasis on  professionalization and narrow career-tracking."

Emphasizing Simpson's achievements in fostering both access and  academic excellence, UW's Dean of Undergraduate Education Fred Campbell  notes, "John has been a true academic leader at the University of  Washington. He is deeply committed to providing access to the next  generation of students, and he consistently works with faculty and chairs to  promote the highest possible academic excellence."

Simpson plans to spend his first weeks in Santa Cruz getting to know  the campus and his new colleagues. When asked about his expectations for  his first activities, he responded, "I look forward to helping define the  academic niches in which UCSC has, or is gaining, exceptional distinction. I  see the potential for some very interesting academic planning, but I can't  make any projections about specific directions the campus might take, until  I've learned more. I want to get to know UC Santa Cruz from top to bottom,  starting with the people."

Among those welcoming Simpson to his first days on the campus is the  person whose office he will fill. Michael Tanner will continue for a brief  transition period, helping to orient the new executive vice chancellor. "John  Simpson's many strengths are a good match for UCSC," Tanner noted. "He will  bring to the campus a solid academic and administrative background with  the broad perspective of someone accustomed to working in a large  institution. I predict his great success."

Simpson graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a B.A. in psychology.  He earned master's and doctoral degrees in neurobiology and behavior at  Northwestern University. Prior to his arrival at the University of Washington,  he worked for two years at the University of Pennsylvania as a research  associate of the Institute of Neurological Sciences and a lecturer in the  department of psychology. He has served as Visiting Professor of Physiology  at the UC San Francisco School of Medicine and at the Howard Florey  Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine in Melbourne, Australia.  In addition to service on numerous academic committees and in the  Academic Senate at the University of Washington, he is a member of the  Board of Trustees of the Pilchuck Glass School and the Intiman Theater  Company and is a director of the Henry Art Gallery.

Simpson's research is in neuroendocrinology, the study of how the  brain and hormones interact. Specifically, he is interested in the role of brain  and endocrine control in the body's ability to regulate body fluids and the  cardiovascular system. He is a member of the American Association for the  Advancement of Science, the Society for Neuroscience, and the Society for the  Study of Ingestive Behavior.

Simpson will move to the area with his wife, Diane. They have two  adult children, Matthew (29) and Melissa (26). Simpson's previous  connection to the University of California is as an alumnus and visiting  professor. In fact, numerous members of the Simpson family are graduates  of the University of California, including his grandmother (UCB), his  grandfather (UCSF), his father (UCB), his mother (UCLA), three sisters (two,  UCB, and one, UCLA), his wife (UCSB), and a daughter (UCSB).
