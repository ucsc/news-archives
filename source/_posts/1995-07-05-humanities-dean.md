SANTA CRUZ--Professor of linguistics Jorge Hankamer has been  appointed dean of the Humanities Division at the University of  California, Santa Cruz. The appointment took effect July 1.

Humanities is one of four academic divisions at UCSC; the  others are Arts, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences. Each division  is home to a wide range of departments and programs. Hankamer  succeeds Gary Lease, a professor of history of consciousness, who  had served as dean since 1990.

In announcing the appointment, Executive Vice Chancellor  Michael Tanner said, "I am pleased to announce that Professor  Hankamer has accepted this position, and I am confident that he will  bring continued leadership and strength to the Humanities Division."

"The humanities face some heavy challenges these days,"  Hankamer said. "We're at a time when resources overall are  diminishing and student interest is in one of the periodic swings  away from humanities to other disciplines. We have the potential to  take a leading role in revitalizing support for and interest in  humanistic knowledge at Santa Cruz. This division is already the  home of a number of exceptional programs."

Hankamer joined the UCSC faculty in 1980 as a member of the  linguistics program--a program with a national reputation for  excellence that he was instrumental in creating. During his tenure he  has served in numerous administrative posts including chair of the  Board of Studies in Linguistics from 1980 to 1990, acting dean of  Graduate Studies from 1993 to 1994, acting dean of Social Sciences  during the fall of 1994, acting chair of the Literature Board from  1993 through last month, and Associate Academic Vice Chancellor of  Planning and Programs from 1990 through last month.

Hankamer holds a B.A. in physics and mathematics and an M.A.  in German literature from Rice University, and a Ph.D. in linguistics  from Yale University. His research focuses on syntax, semantics,  morphology, computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, and  Turkish. He has written numerous articles for professional journals  and has served for the past twenty years as an editor for the series  "Outstanding Dissertations in Linguistics" (Garland Publishing, New  York). In 1991 he was director of the Linguistic Society of America's  Linguistic Institute, a six-week summer program with an  international membership.
