SANTA CRUZ, CA--The challenges and rewards of creating beautiful  gardens suitable to the California climate are the topics of a special  weekend symposium July 13-14 at the Arboretum of the University  of California, Santa Cruz. The symposium, "Designing a California  Garden," features presentations by professional gardeners, tours of  several gardens and nurseries in the Santa Cruz area, and  opportunities to buy many unique and colorful plants.

The symposium will begin with talks and slide shows at the  UCSC Arboretum at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday, July 13. Three well-known  gardeners will share their experiences in settings ranging from  intimate city gardens to broad California meadowlands. Set to speak  are John Greenlee, an internationally renowned horticulturalist  specializing in grasses and grasslike plants; Janet Pollock, a  landscape architect who focuses on Mediterranean plants, California  natives, and old-fashioned plants; and Jeff Rosendale, owner of two  Watsonville nurseries that carry plants from the world's  Mediterranean climates.

On Saturday afternoon, participants will view plants at the  UCSC Arboretum that attract butterflies and hummingbirds, then  will venture off campus for tours of two nearby private gardens.  Garden tours will resume at 10 a.m. on Sunday, July 14. In the  afternoon, the symposium will conclude at the Sierra Azul Nursery  and Gardens in Watsonville.

The symposium is open to the public; early registration is  recommended. Advance fees are $50; registration on the day of the  symposium costs $55. For a registration form or more information,  call the UCSC Arboretum at (408) 427-2998.

The entrance to the UCSC Arboretum is on Empire Grade in  Santa Cruz, one-half mile west of the main entrance to the UCSC  campus.
