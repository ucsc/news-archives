title: Pioneering Geneticist Nancy Wexler To Deliver Public Lecture At UCSC

SANTA CRUZ, CA--For a quarter century, Nancy Wexler has chased  the shadow that Huntington's disease casts upon the lives of 30,000  Americans. The hereditary disorder, which gradually robs its victims  of all muscle control, puts another 150,000 people in this country at  risk--including Wexler herself, whose mother, three uncles, and  maternal grandfather all died from Huntington's.

Spearheaded by Wexler, the progress toward understanding  Huntington's disease has been remarkable. For instance, people now  can take a test to learn whether they will develop the disease,  rather than face an uncertain 50-50 risk for decades. However, the  rapid pace of research on Huntington's typifies a growing concern  among those who study genetic diseases and their roots within our  DNA: Are there ethical boundaries beyond which scientists and  doctors should not use genetic information? And if so, how does  society determine where those boundaries lie?

Such topics will form the heart of a public lecture by Wexler  at UC Santa Cruz on Tuesday, May 2. Her talk, entitled "Genetic  Prediction and Precaution Confront Human Social Values," will begin  at 7:30 p.m. in lecture hall B-206 of the Earth and Marine Sciences  Building. Classroom Unit 2 will serve as an overflow venue, where  the audience will see the lecture via live video.

Although the event is free, advance tickets are required.  Community members may obtain tickets from the UCSC Ticket Office  in person or by calling 459-2159.

Wexler's lecture is part of an ongoing universitywide series  known as the Tanner Lectures on Human Values. The Tanner Lectures  were established by American scholar, industrialist, and  philanthropist Obert Clark Tanner. Their purpose is to advance and  reflect upon the scholarly and scientific learning relating to human  values.

A clinical psychologist by training, Wexler is Higgins  Professor of Neuropsychology at the College of Physicians and  Surgeons of Columbia University. She also is president of the  Hereditary Disease Foundation, founded by her father, Milton Wexler.  In 1993, she received the Albert Lasker Public Service Award--the  highest honor in American medicine--for "her groundbreaking work . . . toward finding a cure for Huntington's disease and for increasing  awareness of all genetic disease."

Indeed, Wexler has helped to push the ethical, legal, and  philosophical issues sparked by genetic testing to the forefront of  public debate. Researchers have discovered genes for many of the  estimated 4,000 hereditary diseases, including cystic fibrosis and  one form of breast cancer; genes that predispose people toward  other ailments, such as heart disease or schizophrenia, may follow  suit as the Human Genome Project churns ahead. As is the case with  Huntington's, early warning tests could become available long before  cures or effective treatments are known. Wexler refers to this  dangerous gap as the "painful hiatus" between prediction and  prevention.

"In our culture, people assume that knowledge is always good,  that you can never have too much information," she told the New York  Times Magazine. "But our experience with Huntington's has shown  that some things may be better left unknown."
