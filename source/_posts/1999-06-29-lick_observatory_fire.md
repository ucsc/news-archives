## Lick Observatory's Main Building Closed Through July 9 Due To Fire Damage

MT. HAMILTON--The main building at Lick Observatory, temporarily closed due to a small fire on June 22, will not reopen until Saturday, July 10. Previously scheduled public events will still be held, including "Music of the Spheres" concerts scheduled for July 9 and 10. In addition, the 120-inch Shane telescope, which is housed in a separate building, will continue to be open during regular visiting hours.

Observatory officials had initially anticipated reopening the main building on June 26, but as the repair work gets under way it appears more time will be needed, said the observatory's assistant director Maureen McLean.

The fire last week broke out in a storage room adjacent to the observatory's gift shop and destroyed most of the gift shop's inventory, except for some items stored elsewhere. In addition to the gift shop, the main building houses the Anna Nickel 40-inch reflecting telescope and the 36-inch Lick refractor telescope, neither of which were damaged in the blaze.
