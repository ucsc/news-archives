SANTA CRUZ, CA--An English literature professor and a Newsday  reporter have won the University of California, Santa Cruz, Alumni  Association's annual Distinguished Teaching and Alumni  Achievement awards for 1995. An employee of the Board of Studies  in Sociology won the university's first-ever Outstanding Staff  Award.

Michael Warren, professor of English literature and a fellow of  Cowell College, won the Distinguished Teaching Award in  recognition of his outstanding teaching of undergraduate students.

Laurie Garrett, author of The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging  Diseases in a World Out of Balance and a science and medical  reporter for Newsday, won the Alumni Achievement Award. The  award recognizes alumni who have made outstanding contributions  to their fields, rendered remarkable service to UCSC, and brought  distinction to the university through personal achievement. Garrett  earned a bachelor's degree in biology from UCSC in 1975.

Susan Curtis, the lead assistant for the Sociology Board, won  the Outstanding Staff Award. The award recognizes staff who have  given sustained, distinguished service to student life, promoted the  growth and improvement of UCSC's programs, and helped preserve its  intellectual and physical environment. It carries a $500 stipend.

The three were nominated for the awards by students, alumni,  faculty, and staff, and were selected by the UCSC Alumni  Association Council.

They will be honored at a ceremony on Saturday, February 3,  from 12:30 to 2 p.m. in the dining hall at UCSC's Stevenson College.  In addition to the awards being presented to Warren, Garrett, and  Curtis, eleven students will be honored for service to their colleges.  The ceremony is open to the public.

**Michael Warren**

Warren has spent a career doing for UCSC's undergraduates  what he wishes had been done for him as a student: demystifying the  study of literature. His teaching interests concern earlier English  writers, especially Shakespeare and his contemporaries, but also  postwar British drama.

"When I was at Oxford as an undergraduate, the whole thing  was taught as a mystery--how people arrived at the conclusions  they got to in literary criticism was never clear," Warren says. "I try  to show students how I come to the conclusions I do, so they can  reach their own."

Warren teaches his courses--many of them large introductory  lecture classes--with a sense of humor, a love of his subjects, and a  great desire to see his students learn. He strives to make  Shakespeare's plays and other literature understandable, exciting,  and accessible.

In recent course evaluations, Warren's students described him  as knowledgeable, dynamic, humorous, devoted, and approachable. His  teaching assistants noted the care he took in reviewing class  material with them and teaching them how to do their job.

Warren especially enjoys teaching lower-division  undergraduates. "It is a chance to reach students early, to give them  a foundation for interpreting all kinds of literature, and particularly  the works of earlier writers," he says. He feels fortunate to work in  a board of studies and a college where such a high value is placed on  teaching.

Warren joined UCSC as an assistant professor in 1968 after  earning a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley and teaching at the University of  Victoria in Canada. He earned his bachelor's degree from Balliol  College, Oxford, and a master's degree from Dalhousie University in  Canada. His numerous print contributions include two books on  Shakespeare's King Lear.

**Laurie Garrett**

A science and medical writer for Newsday who also worked for  National Public Radio and as a freelancer in southern Europe and East  Africa, Garrett spent more than a decade researching her book, The  Coming Plague.

The book is a comprehensive and almost encyclopedic look at a  multitude of diseases that have emerged or reemerged worldwide  over the last three decades. Its subjects range from malaria,  cholera, and newly discovered viral hemorrhagic fevers, to  Legionnaires' disease, toxic shock syndrome, and AIDS.

"In my travels overseas I could see diseases that I thought had  been conquered were in fact killing children right and left," Garrett  says. "The first time I saw a child dying of measles, I learned the  folly of ever describing any disease as minor or eradicated."

Instead, rising population densities, the advent of jet travel,  environmental destruction, and changing social mores are among the  many factors exacerbating the emergence and spread of disease.

Since its publication in October 1994, the 750-page book has  received widespread acclaim. Newspapers and journals from the New  York Times to the New England Journal of Medicine have published  favorable reviews, and the San Francisco Chronicle hailed the book  as "the clearest, most detailed and most impeccably researched  description of the science of microbiology that lay readers have had  since Paul de Kruif's Microbe Hunters of 60 years ago."

Garrett wrote The Coming Plague as a wake-up call to the  world.

"I'm trying to sound an alarm that warns people at all levels of  society, regardless of their work or what they do, that far from  defeating the microbes, we face a whole new force of microbial  threats," she says.

**Susan Curtis**

Although life-and-death issues are seldom a part of Susan  Curtis's job at UCSC's Sociology Board, she treats all that's asked of  her as if it were.

People are a priority, she says. "It's hard for me to close the  door on someone, to put them off," Curtis explains. "I'll help if I can."

Curtis joined UCSC's Division of Social Sciences twenty years  ago and a year later became a board assistant at the Sociology Board.  Her nearly two decades of experience at the board means that  faculty, students, and other staff call on her often for answers,  opinions, and advice.

"She is not only our best source of knowledge about the campus  and board itself--she is, indeed, our true institutional memory--but  the very best source of wisdom, thoughtful judgment, calming  stability, and emotional support on the board," wrote Sociology  Board chair Craig Haney in a letter recommending her for the award.

As the lead board assistant, Curtis works with the board chair,  the graduate director, and two other board assistants to run the  more than 440-student board.

Curtis, who holds a credential to teach grades K-8, says she  never imagined she'd work for UCSC for twenty years. "I used to  chuckle at my aunt who was on the same job for 40 years," she says.  "I never would have pictured doing this--or doing anything--for this  long."

Tickets for the awards ceremony are $12, including lunch. For  reservations, call the Alumni Office at (408) 459-2530.
