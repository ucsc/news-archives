Most people already know that we have a new  chancellor, M.R.C. Greenwood. But  they may not be aware that several other high-level appointments were made since the end of the 1995-96 academic year. Two provosts, an Academic Senate chair, and a vice chancellor are among the new appointments.

David Henry Anthony III, an associate professor of history, was named provost of Oakes College, and Paul Skenazy, a professor of literature, was named provost of Kresge College. Eli Silver, a professor of earth sciences, was named chair of the Academic Senate. Thomas Vani was named vice chancellor of Business and Administrative Services.

Anthony, who replaced associate professor of education Maria Eugenia Matute-Bianchi at Oakes last January, has been provost on an interim basis since then. Anthony came to UCSC in 1988, following a year as a Fulbright lecturer at the National University of Lesotho. He earned his bachelor's degree in history and English from New York University and his master's and doctorate degrees in history from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Anthony specializes in the history of eastern and southern Africa and nineteenth- and twentieth-century African American history.

Skenazy came to UCSC in 1971 from Stanford University. He earned his bachelor's degree in literature from the University of Chicago and his master's and doctorate degrees in literature from Stanford University. A former co-chair of UCSC's Writing Program, Skenazy studies contemporary American literature, especially popular mystery fiction. He replaces professor of anthropology Carolyn Martin Shaw at Kresge.

Silver joined UCSC in 1973 after working as a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey. He received his B.A. in geology from UC Berkeley in 1964 and his Ph.D. in oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego, in 1969. Silver, director of UCSC's Institute of Tectonics, studies tectonic processes near the margins of earth's continents, where the earth's crustal plates collide. He also studies how fluids flow in subduction zones-regions where one crustal plate dives beneath another, often triggering earthquakes. He succeeds Michael Cowan as chair of the Academic Senate.

Vani came to UCSC in August from UC Berkeley, where he had been executive director of financial and business services. He began his career with the University of California fifteen years ago at UCLA, where he oversaw the residence halls and coordinated the Olympic Village. In 1987, he joined UC Berkeley, where his jobs included director of housing and dining services and executive director of auxiliary enterprises. Vani succeeds James Sullivan, who had served as vice chancellor of Business and Administrative Services on an interim basis since last September.

Several other key appointments have been made, including:

Leslie A. Sunell, who will become executive assistant to Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, effective October 9. Sunell earned a Ph.D. in biological science from UC Irvine and conducted postdoctoral research in plant cell and developmental biology at Stanford University. She joined UC Davis in 1984 and has been assistant dean of graduate studies there since 1990. Her responsibilities in this capacity spanned academic planning, student academic affairs and financial support, graduate academic programs, institutional research and analysis, special projects, and human resource and budget management. She replaces Billie Greene, who has been named associate director of international programs at UC Santa Cruz Extension.

Ernest "Ernie" Hudson, executive assistant to Executive Vice Chancellor Michael Tanner. Before coming to UCSC, Hudson was most recently assistant provost for academic affairs at UC Berkeley, where he had worked for fifteen years. He replaces Lea Sterrett, who retired last spring.

Kirk Lew, who as the manager of Financial Information Systems (FIS), heads the new FIS operating unit. Lew came to UCSC from Dominican College of San Rafael, where he was director of financial services. Previously he worked at UC Berkeley as manager of general accounting and financial reporting supervisor. The new FIS unit is responsible for coordinating, maintaining, and enhancing the campus's financial system and for providing user support.

Elizabeth M. Irwin, director of public information and publications, who will take on additional duties as the assistant to the chancellor for communications with external constituencies as of October 1\. In her new capacity, Irwin will be responsible for developing and implementing UCSC's community and governmental relations programs, with a special focus on fostering partnerships between the university and the community.

Lora Lee Martin, who became the director of UC's Monterey Bay Education, Science, and Technology (MBEST) Center as of July 1 and who has taken on expanded responsibilities in the federal governmental affairs arena. Martin was formerly director of government research affairs and regional economic development. She succeeds James Gill, who directed the MBEST Center at the former Fort Ord on a part-time basis for the past three years.
