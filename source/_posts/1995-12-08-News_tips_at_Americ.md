(5) Near-surface geology dramatically affects direction of  earthquake shaking Session S11C, talk #2, Monday a.m. 12/11

The direction of the most damaging shaking in a quake at any one  place often depends more upon geologic structures near the surface  than the location or the mechanism of the quake itself.


(1) Study unveils a way to probe fault zones before a quake hits

Thursday, December 14, 8:30 a.m.-noon Session S41A, poster #27 Moscone Center, Hall D Presenter: Justin Revenaugh (408) 459-3055 or jsr@earthsci.ucsc.edu

A new technique may let seismologists estimate which parts  of a fault are likely to rupture most severely during an earthquake,  even if the fault hasn't broken for a century or more.

The technique relies upon an apparent connection between the  pre-earthquake geology of a fault zone and the amount of motion  that a quake triggers along different segments of the fault. A  similar relationship exists between fault-zone geology and the  pattern of aftershocks that strike after the main earthquake.

UC Santa Cruz seismologist Justin Revenaugh, who devised the  method, says it cannot predict when an earthquake will happen or  how large it will be. However, the method may help researchers  refine their maps of seismic hazard by hinting in advance which  fault segments will pack the biggest wallop. That information could  prove especially useful for the many mysteriously "locked" segments  in southern California and elsewhere.

"It's difficult to figure out how much slip might occur on  locked faults," says Revenaugh. "This scheme begins to give us a  rational way of looking at each fault and dividing it into segments.  Those segments are the building blocks that could break in one large  earthquake or several smaller ones."

Revenaugh draws his conclusions from an analysis of the  magnitude 7.3 Landers temblor and two other sizable quakes that  ripped across California's Mojave Desert region in 1992. His study  appeared in the November 24 issue of the journal Science. At the  AGU meeting, Revenaugh will present further work, based on  applying the same technique to the San Andreas, San Jacinto, and  other locked faults in southern California.

Revenaugh adapted a technique used by researchers to monitor  nuclear tests. Effectively, waves from earthquakes can serve as  sonar-like "pings" to probe the earth's crust. Revenaugh's method  models the rocks within the crust as a swarm of points that scatter  energy, like fish in the water scatter sonar. Quakes from across the  globe send waves through the swarm. Seismographs receive the  echoes; their intensity and timing tells Revenaugh which points  scatter the energy most strongly. Pronounced scattering exposes an  abrupt change in the earth's structure, such as a dense network of  cracks along a fault.

He notes that the method will not unravel the tectonic  complexities of the Los Angeles Basin, because most faults there  rupture in a different way and are too close together for the method  to resolve. But he feels confident it will shed light on locked  segments of major strike-slip faults--such as a long stretch of the  San Andreas from Cholame to San Bernardino, which unleashed a  huge earthquake (bigger than magnitude 8) in 1857 but hasn't budged  since.


(2) A 5000-year "movie" of earthquake activity in southern  California

Monday, December 11, 3:15 p.m. Session T12B, talk #8 Moscone Center, room 130 Speaker: Steven Ward (408) 459-2480 or ward@uplift.ucsc.edu

Many a seismologist dreams of having a record of all quakes in  southern California for the last 5,000 years. So, Steven Ward made  one--using a computer tool called "synthetic seismicity."

With a complete catalog of earthquakes down to magnitude 4  for several thousand years, Ward says, scientists could address  some of the most elusive mysteries of earthquake occurrence: Do  quakes cluster in location and time? Where are the active blind- thrust faults? Do century-long cycles in seismicity exist? Can past  earthquakes predict future ones? Alas, the reliable historical record  of southern California quakes is 150 years long at best. Synthetic  seismicity, says Ward, can supplement that record--even though the  results are not unique.

"Insights into these questions are so profound that the dream  is worth pursuing, at least as a thought experiment realized through  computer simulations," Ward says. "Inferences on long-term  behaviors of earthquakes drawn from plausible computer  simulations are no more suspect than those drawn from conventional  tactics that stitch together woefully short earthquake histories, or  which boldly extrapolate laboratory results over orders of time and  length."

Ward, a geophysicist at UC Santa Cruz, has developed and  refined his synthetic seismicity model over the last several years.  In general, the model uses the laws of how stress accumulates and  releases in the earth. Ward constrains the model with physical data  where they are available, such as the locations of fault segments,  the characteristic magnitudes of quakes there, and geodetic data  that map strain throughout a region. Ward's past studies have shown  that his simulated quakes happen far less regularly than researchers  have assumed.

At the AGU meeting, Ward will discuss his latest work--a  maplike 5,000-year catalog of synthetic seismicity for 14 major  faults in southern California. The model accounts both for bends in  the faults and for stresses that build up across faults, not just  along them. Highlights of the study, which has been submitted for  publication, include the following:

* The largest earthquakes, magnitude 7.5 and above, happen  with some degree of regularity at any given location. "They really do  control everything," Ward says, "but they only happen every 200 to  300 years."
* Moderate quakes (magnitude 6 to 7) occur essentially  randomly, while smaller quakes (magnitude 5 to 6) show some  clustering patterns.
* Some cycles appear in the numbers of magnitude 5 and 6  quakes. Variations in the timing of small earthquakes can foretell  cycles of larger events, but only when averaged over periods of at  least 100 years.

"This is a computer model, but it satisfies all of the observed  data we know," Ward adds. He says the model can contribute to an  overall map of seismic hazard for the region.

(3) A thin, partially molten region in the lower mantle, just above  the core?

Wednesday, December 13, 4-5 p.m. Session S32E, talks #10, 11, and 13 Moscone Center, room 304 Speakers: Quentin Williams (408/459-3132 or quentw@rupture.ucsc.edu), Thorne Lay (408/459-3164 or thorne@rupture.ucsc.edu), and Ed Garnero  (408/459-5139 or eddie@rupture.ucsc.edu)

Geophysicists didn't think any component of the lower mantle  was molten, not even partially. Now, a peculiar type of seismic wave  may be proving them wrong.

Careful analysis of recordings of this seismic wave, still in  progress, seems to point to an unusual material within a thin layer  at the base of the mantle, just above the core-mantle boundary. The  wave travels so sluggishly through this layer--at least 10 percent  more slowly than expected--that researchers suggest some portion  of the rock there may be molten.

To make matters more enticing, the layer does not span the  globe. Rather, seismologists have spotted it in only one place: a zone  1,800 miles beneath the south-central Pacific Ocean. Other workers  already had identified a particularly warm patch of mantle in a  broad swath above this area.

"The seismic discovery of this very slow layer is exciting,"  says seismologist Ed Garnero of UC Santa Cruz, "but the physical  interpretation is a totally open frontier." Garnero and two other  UCSC researchers, mineral physicist Quentin Williams and  geophysicist Thorne Lay, will discuss the unusual layer or refer to it  during parts of their talks at the AGU meeting.

The seismic wave illuminating the layer is a "diffractive"  wave. The wave skims for some distance along the mantle side of  the boundary between the molten outer core and the solid lower  mantle, a dynamic part of the inner earth. As the wave ripples, some  property of the material in this zone slows it down. That shows up  as an extra bump in recordings of earthquakes. Garnero, who is  scrutinizing the recordings with John Vidale of UCLA and others,  believes the layer is no more than 40 kilometers thick, and perhaps  is as thin as 5 kilometers in spots.

Enter Williams, who studies the properties of inner-earth  minerals under high pressures and temperatures. "If the velocity  anomaly is 10 percent and the layer is only about 20 kilometers  thick, I don't see how you can do it other than with a partial melt,"  he says. The logical candidate for such a melt would be  magnesiowustite, a mineral in which an atom of either magnesium  or iron links up with an oxygen atom. Even so, the fraction of melt  would be low, since magnesiowustite probably composes only 20 to  40 percent of the lower mantle. "This region has not lost its  rigidity," Williams says. "It's still behaving like a solid."

Williams notes his interpretation depends critically on the  seismic data. If the layer is thicker than suspected, or if the  velocity changes are not as great, other notions would suffice. For  instance, the region may feature strong chemical interactions  between the outer core and the lower mantle--an explanation many  researchers find more palatable.

If the partial-melt hypothesis bears up, it could provide a new  gauge of the temperature of that zone. Such fixed points of reference  for the inner earth, Williams says, are hard to come by.

(4) Supercomputer models open new window on icy era

Monday, December 11, 2 p.m. Session O12A, talk #2 Moscone Center, room 310 Speaker: Lisa Sloan (408) 459-3693 or lcsloan@earthsci.ucsc.edu

Climate modelers have united to study the Last Glacial  Maximum, when ice sheathed much of the globe. One such model  offers notable insights into how the climate may have behaved.

The modelers convened under the auspices of the Paleoclimate  Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP), an international effort to  compare the results of different approaches to simulating past  climates on the earth. One of the first phases of PMIP focuses on the  height of the last ice age, about 21,000 years ago. The researchers  will present their early results publicly for the first time at the  AGU meeting.

Debate simmers over a particular aspect of the last ice age:  How much did the tropics cool? According to CLIMAP, a 1970s study  that analyzed fossilized marine organisms, tropical oceans were no  more than 2 degrees C cooler than today, while other parts of the  globe were at least 5 degrees C colder. But in recent years,  scientists tracking clues such as groundwater chemistry, corals, and  snow lines on mountains have claimed evidence of much chillier  tropical conditions during the ice age. The argument is not merely  academic, for it may shed light on how circulation in the ocean--one  of the planet's main conveyor belts of heat--reacts to climatic  changes.

UC Santa Cruz paleoclimatologist Lisa Sloan used a powerful  model to probe the ice age: GENESIS, which runs on a supercomputer  at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. PMIP organizers  supplied a set of initial conditions used by all of the models,  including levels of solar radiation, concentration of carbon dioxide  in the atmosphere, sea level, and the extent of ice sheets. For the  first time, GENESIS and two other models used that information to  compute sea-surface temperatures. Sloan's results tend to side with  CLIMAP: a modest, but not extreme, cooling of the tropical ocean.

Sloan also had GENESIS consider a scenario where more heat  flowed through the ocean, from the tropics toward the poles. This  substantially cooled the tropical seas, but at the expense of heating  up polar regions too much to agree with data from the ice age.  "Ocean circulation patterns probably were different during the ice  age than they are today," says Sloan, "but not necessarily in a way  that increased heat transport toward the poles."

GENESIS also concluded that the massive ice sheet over North  America did not force the jet stream to divide, contrary to what  researchers had assumed. PMIP scientists developed a new model of  the planet's icy blanket at the Last Glacial Maximum, with a  somewhat thinner layer of ice overlying North America. The jet  stream, so critical to weather patterns, then whizzes intact across  the continent instead of splitting in two and rejoining in the North  Atlantic. All PMIP models thus far agree on this result, Sloan notes.


(5) Near-surface geology dramatically affects direction of  earthquake shaking

Monday, December 11, 9:15 a.m. Session S11C, talk #2 Moscone Center, room 124 Speaker: Ornella Bonamassa (408) 459-4426 or ornella@earthsci.ucsc.edu

The direction of the most damaging shaking in a quake at any  one place often depends more upon geologic structures near the  surface than the location or the mechanism of the quake itself.

UC Santa Cruz seismologists Ornella Bonamassa, John Vidale  (now at UCLA), and others first reached that conclusion five years  ago by studying records from the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake  and aftershocks of the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. Now, a detailed field  study in the Santa Cruz Mountains has confirmed and refined the  results, giving the team enough data to construct 2-D and 3-D  models of the curious phenomenon.

The experiment used an array of 24 seismometers spaced 10  meters apart on a remote slope near the Zayante Fault. The team  used different tools to bombard the site with two types of seismic  energy: compressional "P" waves and shear "S" waves. Directions of  the strongest ground motion swiveled by as much as 45 to 90  angular degrees among the sites, in apparent response to variations  in soil and rock conditions within the top 20 meters of the terrain.

Next, the researchers used mathematical methods to invert the  data and create a 3-D map of the speeds of seismic waves through  the study area. They found that S waves traveled 400 meters per  second in some spots but as quickly as 700 meters per second in  others--extreme variations for such a small study area. Because the  stations were so close together, the velocity map was accurate to a  scale of just 1 meter. "This is the first time such powerful  tomographic and waveform studies have been applied to such fine-scale P-wave and S-wave structure," Bonamassa says.

The map revealed the surface of an old landslide under the  study area. The scientists suspect that jumbled and loosely packed  material above the landslide amplified ground motions in preferred  directions. At sites where the near-surface geology is more uniform,  they say, the directions of the most severe motions would depend  not on local site conditions but on the location of the quake and its  focal mechanism--that is, the way in which the fault plane ruptures.

The team made a successful 2-D model of these "directional  site resonances" using three inputs: the velocity map, the topography  of the site, and the scattering of seismic energy. At the AGU  meeting, Bonamassa will discuss early work on the 3-D model,  which also is promising but has not yet reproduced the largest  variations in motion from the study.

As the technique for analyzing these "directional site  resonances" evolves, Bonamassa says, it should help structural  engineers. In particular, long structures such as dams or large  buildings may experience unforeseen stresses if the ground beneath  them amplifies earthquake waves in a few different directions.  Engineers may be able to design safer structures by ascertaining the  probable directions of strong shaking at each site.
