title: Second Public Hearing On Proposed Parking Structure
author: M.R.C. Greenwood, Chancellor
---

In response to requests from members of the Santa Cruz community and the campus community, I have decided to extend the public comment period on the Draft EIR for the proposed Core West Parking Structure and to hold a second public hearing on the Draft EIR. I announced this decision at the annual City-University meeting on Tuesday, and I want to take this opportunity to make this information as widely known as possible.

The public comment period on the Draft EIR will be extended to 7 PM on April 13, 1999, and a second public hearing will be held at the Civic Auditorium (at the corner of Church Street and Center Street in downtown Santa Cruz) between 5 PM and 7 PM on April 13, 1999. Members of the public are invited to attend the hearing and to provide comments on the Draft EIR for the parking structure. The Final EIR will include responses to comments, and the Regents will consider the EIR prior to any decision to approve, revise, or reject the proposed project.

Please share this information widely, including with members of our neighboring community with whom you may have contact.
