**Book Is Accompanied By Cd-ROM Containing A Version Of The Program And Music Samples**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Commander Data; HAL 9000; Robbie, the robot-- speculation on the potential of computers has generated some  extraordinary fictional characters. In recent years, a number of  real-life computer programs have emerged that are nearly as  remarkable as their fictional counterparts, if not quite as quirky.  Chess whiz Deep Blue is one of the most famous in this new  generation of computer prodigies, but it's not the only one. Another  is EMI--a program that composes its own music.

EMI is the subject of the newly released book, Experiments in  Musical Intelligence (A-R Editions, Inc., Computer Music and Digital  Audio Series, Vol. 12, June 1996, $49.95). The book is the second in a  planned trilogy on EMI by David Cope, EMI's inventor and a professor  of music at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Pronounced "emmy" and short for Experiments in Musical  Intelligence, EMI composes original music in the style of other  composers. Of the 100 or so programs in the world creating music  through computer algorithms, EMI is rare in that it operates by  analyzing and recombining previously composed music. The program  took six years to create and has been operational since 1987 when it  composed its first sonata in the style of Mozart. Cope uses EMI as  both a compositional tool and to understand musical style.

Experiments in Musical Intelligence extends the concepts  presented in Cope's previous book, Computers and Musical Style (Vol.  6 in the A-R series). The new book offers further explanation of  Cope's intriguing program as well as theory on musical style. In  addition, users can try out a simpler version of EMI for themselves  through a scaled-down program and databases supplied on an  attached 630-megabyte CD-ROM. (To use the program, users must  have MIDI equipment.)

Experiments in Musical Intelligence explains in clear language  everything users need to know to understand EMI's six-step  algorithm and operate the accompanying program without having to  resort to reference manuals or other programming books. Cope not  only gives readers the program--named SARA for Simple Analytic  Recombinance Algorithm--but provides the program's source code.  Having access to the source code allows users to examine the  structure of the program and alter it if they wish. Most programs are  released as object codes that cannot be examined or altered.

"When anyone makes a program it's biased toward his or her  own personality. Those who use SARA can personalize it and make  something that works to their own taste," Cope explains.

Along with explaining the workings of the program,  Experiments in Musical Intelligence explores musical style. Most  music lovers can identify a well-known composer simply by  listening to the music for a moment, but explaining why that music  is recognizable is more difficult. Using EMI, Cope has developed  methods that may help musicologists understand style. "Because  they can handle massive amounts of data, computers enable us to  look at musical style in a concrete way we have not looked at  before," he explains. "They give us information that we can quantify  and patterns that we can recognize." David Cope

Cope is a respected composer whose works, in the genre of  twentieth century-classical music, have been performed around the  world. He is the author of New Directions in Music, one of the most  popular textbooks on twentieth-century music, now in its sixth  edition.

Cope began work on EMI in the early 1980s when he was  commissioned to write an opera and found himself facing a  composing block. He conceived an artificial intelligence program  that could serve as a composing tool to help with the block. Cope  completed EMI six years later and, with the program's help, finished  his commission. Titled Cradle Falling, the opera received rave  reviews.

Cope's EMI-related recordings are Bach by Design (1994,  Centaur Recordings CRC 2184) and Dedications (forthcoming). His  first book on EMI is Computers and Musical Style (A-R Editions,  1991). Other publications include New Music Composition (1977;  second edition forthcoming) and New Music Notation (1976). EMI (Experiments in Musical Intelligence)

The works it has produced have been performed in concert and  released on the CD Bach by Design (1994). Since it became  operational in 1987, EMI has created music in the styles of such  composers as Mozart, Bach, Stravinsky, Gershwin, Joplin, and Cope.

EMI's six-step algorithm works like this: The user carefully  selects and inputs compatible works of music from a composer  (pieces with similar tempos, ranges, and orchestration); EMI  analyzes them; identifies signatures (characteristics unique to the  composer); breaks the music into its components; recombines the  music into a new piece that preserves the composer's signatures;  and, ultimately, performs it.
