![\[Photo of Sammy, UCSC's new mascot\]][1] Sammy, UCSC's new mascot, strikes a contemplative pose during a ceremony on Tuesday, September 29, in which the mascot was introduced to the campus, community, and world. Sammy's debut came on the East Field during the annual Fall Festival, sponsored by the Office of  Physical Education, Recreation and Sports. Chancellor Greenwood and new Executive Vice Chancellor John Simpson were on hand, as was athletic director Mark Majeski, who concluded Sammy's introduction this way: "We want everyone to know that we are the Slugs, we are here, and we are proud."
