MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--Frank Drake, president of the SETI (Search for  Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute in Mountain View and  research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz,  has issued the following statement about the death today of  astronomer Carl Sagan. Drake and Sagan were close friends and  longtime working colleagues, dating to their simultaneous tenures  as professors of astronomy at Cornell University in the 1960s.

Drake's statement, which may be used with attribution, is as  follows:

"The passing of Carl Sagan is a great loss not just to the  community of science, but to the entire world. He cherished and  advocated reason and honesty in human understanding of both the  natural world and humanity itself. He had deep insights into the  place and future of humans in the cosmos, and was outstanding at  communicating those insights.

"At the SETI Institute, there is now a sad vacancy on our Board  of Directors; we valued his guidance very highly. He was a dedicated  advocate of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and did  much to bring into being the great respect now enjoyed by this field.  The world has lost a true irreplaceable leader."
