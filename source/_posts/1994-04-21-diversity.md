SANTA CRUZ, CA--Cultural diversity has become such a buzz phrase  that when Dr. Judy B. Rosener gives talks on the subject, she often  feels compelled to ask her audience to think about why it is  important to value diversity. "The reason to value diversity is not  because it's politically correct but because diversity makes for a  rich learning environment," says Rosener, an expert in organizational  management.

Rosener will discuss the value of cultural diversity in higher  education during a free public lecture at UC Santa Cruz on Tuesday,  May 10, at 4 p.m. in the Stevenson Fireside Lounge. Her talk is titled  "Valuing Cultural Diversity: Why Should You Care?"

Rosener is on the faculty of the Graduate School of  Management at the University of California, Irvine. She teaches and  does research in the areas of cultural diversity, men and women at  work, and business and government. She is coauthor of Workforce  America! Managing Employee Diversity as a Vital Resource, which is  used in corporations, government agencies, and educational  institutions.

"Diversity has to do with differences in the way problems are  conceptualized and solved, as well as with race, gender, ethnicity,  sexual orientation, and physical ability," says Rosener. "The  corporate world is beginning to understand this. A great example is  car design. Obviously, if women had been designing cars, there would  be a place for a purse."

Rosener will talk about why the corporate world increasingly  views cultural diversity as a resource, while campuses still tend to  view it as a problem. Although diversity makes things more  complicated, Rosener maintains that the difficulties are offset by  its value as a source of new ideas and ways of thinking. "Because  new ideas are so fundamental to research and teaching, I often  wonder why educational institutions see diversity primarily in  terms of affirmative action compliance," she says.

Rosener's lecture is the third in the Chancellor's Distinguished  Seminar Series on Mission, Quality, and Diversity, established in the  fall by Chancellor Karl S. Pister and the Academic Senate. The  seminars are the public part of a program in which prominent women  and minorities spend a day with faculty and students to discuss how  to improve the quality of higher education in the United States.
