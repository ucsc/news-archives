SANTA CRUZ, CA--Angela Davis, a professor of history of  consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been  appointed to the Presidential Chair at UCSC. Davis is the third UCSC  faculty member to receive appointment to the chair, following  Professors Hayden White and Richard Wasserstrom.

UC President Jack W. Peltason appointed Davis--whose  research focuses on women of color, feminism, and theories of  crime and punishment--on UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister's  recommendation. The appointment, which took effect January 1, will  extend through June 30, 1997.

UCSC Executive Vice Chancellor R. Michael Tanner said Davis's  proposal was selected from "a number of outstanding nominations"  submitted by the campus's academic divisions. "We were particularly  impressed by Professor Davis's innovative ideas for the creation of  undergraduate courses addressing the ethnic studies requirement of  our campus, the involvement of advanced graduate students with  faculty in this project, and the cultivation of cooperative  interactions with colleagues at the UC Santa Barbara campus," he  said.

The UC Regents in 1981 established an endowment fund to  support Presidential Chairs on each of UC's nine campuses. The  purpose of the chairs is to encourage new or interdisciplinary  program development or to enhance the quality of existing university  programs. Annual support for each chair is estimated at $30,000, the  equivalent of the previous year's interest income from the campus's  share of the endowment fund.

Davis plans to use resources from the endowment to work with  faculty and students in the Women of Color Research Cluster,  affiliated with UCSC's Center for Cultural Studies, and to develop  new courses satisfying the general education ethnic studies  requirement, to be taught by both graduate students and permanent  faculty. "I want to use the chair to encourage graduate student and  permanent faculty involvement in undergraduate education," said  Davis.

She also plans to continue to pursue several research projects  on women in California's prisons, studying the legislative process  and "building bridges between academic research, public policy, and  community organizing," she said.

Davis will work with UC Santa Barbara to develop a Ph.D.  program in African American studies at that campus. She hopes to  set up a student exchange between that program and UCSC's history  of consciousness program.

Davis joined the UCSC faculty in 1991 after serving on the San  Francisco State University faculty for several years. She has also  lectured at Stanford University and the Claremont Colleges and  served as acting assistant professor of philosophy at UCLA. She  studied at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, at Johann Wolfgang  von Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany, and at UC San Diego.

Since joining UCSC, Davis has worked with the Women of Color  Research Cluster, sponsoring research projects, a women of color  film festival, and a lecture series.

Davis has written a number of articles and books, including  Women, Culture, and Politics (1988); Women, Race, and Class (1982);  and Angela Davis, An Autobiography (1974). She has recently  completed a book titled "Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Billie Holiday:  Black Women's Music and the Shaping of Social Consciousness" for  Random House.

History of consciousness is an interdisciplinary graduate  program at UCSC concentrating primarily on the humanities and  social sciences. Work in the program centers on the history of  different cultural organizations and expressions and on the analysis  of fundamental ideas of human nature, society, and community that  shape social practices and customs. The chief goal of the program is  to develop informed scholars interested in relating learning to  contemporary social, cultural, and political issues.
