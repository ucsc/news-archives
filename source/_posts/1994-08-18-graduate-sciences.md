SANTA CRUZ, CA--The U.S. Department of Education has awarded two  grants totaling $520,146 to the University of California, Santa Cruz,  to support 22 graduate students, especially women and minorities,  in the fields of biology and physics.

The grants are part of a Department of Education program  called Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need, or GAANN.  According to the program manager, GAANN fellowships go to  graduate students of superior ability who plan careers in teaching or  research, "to sustain and enhance the nation's capacity for teaching  and research in designated academic areas."

Thirteen UCSC graduate students in biology and nine in physics  will receive fellowships for the 1994-95 school year. Each student  will receive a $14,400 stipend and $9,243 to cover tuition, fees, and  other educational costs. As they proceed toward their doctoral  degrees, the students will be eligible for an additional two years of  GAANN support.

"This is the first year we have applied to the GAANN program,  and we are delighted to receive fellowships in two academic areas,"  says Ronaldo Ramirez, assistant to the dean of the Division of  Graduate Studies. "The fellowships will help us attract new and  talented graduate students to UCSC. They also will allow us to use  other fellowship funds to support students who currently receive  less financial support."

Ramirez notes that UCSC already receives nearly $400,000 per  year from the Department of Education under the Patricia Roberts  Harris Fellowship Program. Those funds support eighteen women and  minorities pursuing graduate degrees in the natural sciences.

For the 1994-95 GAANN program, the academic areas targeted  by the Department of Education were biology, chemistry, foreign  languages, engineering, mathematics, and physics. Program  administrators awarded 80 new grants, totaling $18.3 million, to  universities nationwide, as well as 46 noncompeting continuation  grants worth $9 million.
