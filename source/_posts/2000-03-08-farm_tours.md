## Free Public Tours Of The UC Santa Cruz Farm Offered Weekly

SANTA CRUZ, CA--On a clear day, you can see forever. Well, okay, maybe only across the bay to Monterey, but the views from the UCSC Farm are pretty spectacular, and spring is a perfect time to visit. Whether you come to appreciate the views or to find inspiration for your garden, free docent-led tours of the Farm are offered twice weekly through October.

Docents share organic gardening tips with visitors as they lead walks through the Farm's lush gardens, busy greenhouses, productive orchards, and fields of row crops. A spring visit offers the sight of apple trees in bloom, peas sprouting in moist earth, and greenhouses brimming with young plants.

The one-hour tours are available each week, and visitors have the opportunity to learn about growing flowers, fruits, and vegetables organically, as well as about composting, propagation, and the university's research in sustainable agriculture.

Tours begin this year on March 23 and take place on Thursdays at noon and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tours begin at the Louise Cain Gatehouse on the UCSC Farm, which is located above the historic Blacksmith Shop near the base of campus. Free parking is available on weekends in the Physical Plant parking lot across the road from the Blacksmith Shop.
