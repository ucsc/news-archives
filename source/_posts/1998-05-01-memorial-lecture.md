**Peter Hall, Professor Of Government At Harvard University, Will Speak At UCSC's Stevenson College On May 11**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Peter Hall, whose honors in political science include the field's prestigious Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award, will deliver the inaugural Richard Gordon Memorial Lecture at UC Santa Cruz on Monday, May 11.

Hall is a professor of government and senior associate of the Center for European Studies at Harvard University. The free public lecture, titled "Comparative Capitalism in an Era of Globalization," begins at 3:30 p.m. in the Fireside Lounge at UCSC's Stevenson College. A reception will follow in the college's Silverman Conference Room.

Hall has published numerous book and articles on the economic issues of western Europe. He received the Woodrow Wilson award--given each year by the American Political Science Association to the author of the best book on government, politics, or international affairs--for his 1987 book, Governing the Economy.

The first annual lecture honors Richard Gordon, a longtime member of UCSC's politics department who died of cancer in March 1996. A native of Australia, Gordon joined the UCSC faculty in 1977 and taught comparative politics and political economy. He also was a preceptor and taught the core course at Stevenson College for a number of years.

Gordon helped establish the Silicon Valley Research Group, cofounded the UCSC Center for the Study of Global Transformations, and was one of the founders of GLOBE, an international research group on global production. He was also a fellow of both the Institute of Work and Technology in Germany and the University of Sunderland in England.
