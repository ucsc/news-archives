SANTA CRUZ, CA--Thirteen talented students from regional community  colleges have been awarded $20,000 scholarships to attend the University of  California, Santa Cruz. Recipients receive $10,000 scholarships for each of  two years, the support of a strong academic mentoring program, and  assistance finding paid summer work experience in a field that complements  their studies.

Now in its fifth year, the scholarship program has helped dozens of  community college transfer students realize their dream of a university  education. "This scholarship program is an important piece of the bridge  we're building with community colleges," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C.  Greenwood. "Many of these transfer students are the first in their family to  attend college, and a four-year degree was out of reach without this  assistance. We are pleased to provide scholarships to these accomplished  and deserving individuals."

The Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards Program was  established in 1993 by former UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister to increase  opportunities for talented community college students who want to transfer  to UCSC. The scholarships recognize students who have overcome adverse  socioeconomic circumstances, who have a demonstrated commitment to  assisting and improving the lives of others, and who might not otherwise be  able to attend UCSC for financial reasons. Candidates are nominated by the  presidents of each of 13 regional community colleges, and recipients are  selected by Greenwood in consultation with the Leadership Opportunity  Awards Program Screening Committee.

A list of this year's recipients follows, with hometowns and college  affiliations.
* Manuel Bravo of Daly City, Skyline College (Mills Family Scholar)
* Erin Broderick of San Mateo, Ca√±ada College
* Kinshasa Curl of San Jose, Evergreen Valley College (Mills Family  Scholar)
* Carol Diaz of San Jose, San Jose City College (Hahn Scholar)
* Olga Diaz of Watsonville, Cabrillo College (Hahn Scholar)
* Vanessa Gilfoy of Morgan Hill, Gavilan College (Neufeld-Levin  Family Scholar)
* Mahshad Kamali of Campbell, West Valley College (Hahn Scholar)
* Maria Reyes of San Jose, Mission College
* Morag Taylor of Pacific Grove, Monterey Peninsula College (Mills  Family Scholar)
* Maria Villagomez of Greenfield, Hartnell College (Porter Family  Scholar)
* Sally Winterberg of Mountain View, Foothill College
* Joan Wuischpard of San Jose, DeAnza College
* Marjan Rotting of El Granada, College of San Mateo

Up to 13 recipients are selected each year. A $5.2 million endowment  is being established to fund the program permanently. Named scholarships  honor contributors of major gifts to the program. A gift of $10,000  establishes a named scholarship for one year; an endowment of $200,000  creates a permanent named scholarship.
