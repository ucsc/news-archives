**Robert Kibrick,** a computer specialist at UCO/Lick Observatory, has been appointed to an advisory committee that is guiding the Internet2 project, a national effort to develop high-speed network capability for researchers. As a member of the Application Strategy Council of the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (UCAID), Kibrick will advise on technical design, development priorities, and other aspects of advanced network applications. Internet2 is a collaborative effort by over 120 U.S. research universities, working with partners in government and industry, to establish a new Internet backbone with high-bandwidth connectivity.

Kibrick's involvement in this project stems from his work to support remote observations at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii by astronomers on the mainland (see [Kibrick's home page][2]). Most of the astronomers that use the Keck Observatory live in California and work at UC campuses or the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Kibrick has been trying to establish a high-speed network path between Keck Observatory and these California sites, including UCSC.

Professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics **Donald Osterbrock** has been elected a corresponding member of the Academia Mexicana de Ciencias (AMC), the Mexican equivalent of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Osterbrock has worked closely with Mexican astrophysicists, particularly those studying gaseous nebulae and ionized gas in galaxies. He is the first astronomer to be elected as a corresponding member of the AMC, which was established in 1959.
