SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California, Santa Cruz, Foundation has  elected  Stoddard P. Johnston of Pebble Beach to a second term as president of the  board, announced Daniel G. Aldrich III, assistant chancellor for university  advancement. In addition, the Foundation has appointed five new trustees.

The Foundation promotes and supports academic programs,  scholarships, and fellowships and capital improvements at UCSC through its  private fund-raising efforts.

Johnston is chairman and CEO of KBOQ, a classical music station based  in Monterey. "Serving a second year as president affords appropriate  transition between former chancellor Pister and UCSC's new chancellor,  M.R.C. Greenwood," said Johnston. "Having met with her, I am impressed with  her quick grasp of the campus and I look forward to assisting her in meeting  key people in the greater Monterey Bay community."

Also renamed as officers of the board were George A. Malloch of  Belmont as vice president and Fred S. Farr of Carmel as parliamentarian. The  officers' second term began July 1.

Also on July 1, the newly appointed trustees began three-year terms.

Three of the trustees--Burney J. Le Boeuf, professor emeritus at UCSC;  Mona Meade, general manager of Telecommunications, Inc. (TCI) Cablevision;  and attorney Timothy J. Morgan--are residents of Santa Cruz County. Also  newly appointed are Edward C. Thayer of Berkeley and Donald R. Worn of Los  Gatos.

"I am delighted with the addition of these new trustees," said Aldrich.  "They will bring increased interaction with new constituencies, which will  help expand appreciation and understanding of the important work being done  by the people at UC Santa Cruz."

The new trustees bring a variety of experiences to the board:
* Burney Le Boeuf is a research professor at UCSC and directs the  university's elephant seal research program at Ano Nuevo. Having studied  elephant seals at Ano Nuevo for more than 25 years, Le Boeuf is considered  the foremost authority on the animals' biology and behavior. He has written  two books and more than 100 research articles and is a member of the  American Association for the Advancement of Science. Le Boeuf earned a  bachelor's degree and Ph.D. from UC Berkeley and a master's degree from San  Francisco State University. He lives in Santa Cruz with his wife, Joanne  Reiter.
* A resident of Aptos, Mona Meade joined TCI Cablevision in 1982. She  is currently the company's general manager for the east San Francisco Bay  Area.

Morgan is a longtime member of the Santa Cruz County  Republican Central Committee, of which he is currently the chair, and the  Republican State Central Committee. In August, he will begin a four-year  term as California Republican National Committeeman, replacing State  Attorney General Dan Lungren in that position. A native of Santa Cruz,  Morgan earned a bachelor's degree in politics from UCSC in 1970 and a  degree from UC Davis Law School in 1973.
