**Daniel G. Aldrich III,** assistant chancellor for University Advancement, received the Tribute Award from the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) District 7. The award was presented at the district's annual meeting, held December 7 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco and attended by more than 800 people. It recognizes Aldrich's longtime commitment to excellence in education and his dedication to mentoring and service. The Tribute Award is the highest honor the district bestows annually upon one of its members. "Dan Aldrich has worked tirelessly to advance the programs and reputations of the University of California system, and his commitments and experiences have positively influenced seven separate UC campuses," wrote UC Riverside vice chancellor Jim Erickson in the Tribute Award program. "His work ethic, his passion for the University, his sensitivity to its donors and loyalty are so essential to our work. He is richly deserving of the CASE Tribute Award," Erickson added.

Aldrich will be leaving UCSC this month to work on special projects at the Office of the President with Bruce B. Darling, vice president for University and External Relations.

CASE is an international association of education advancement officers, including alumni administrators, fund-raisers, public relations managers, publications editors, and government relations officers. District 7 draws members from Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, and Utah.

**Nancy Loshkajian,** executive director of development, is featured in the new book, _Women as Fundraisers: Their Experience in and Influence on an Emerging Profession _(San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1998). Loshkajian is one of five women whose experiences and viewpoints are presented in a chapter called "Executive Women in Development: Career Paths, Life Choices, and Advancing to the Top," by Sondra Shaw-Hardy. Among the insights Loshkajian shared was this tip: "The donor knows and can sense whether you really care about what you're raising money for . . . and they want to give to someone who cares about the institution." Loshkajian, who pursued a career in opera before going into fundraising, said her passion for the arts helped her get a job with the University of Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. Ironically, she noted, as she has ascended to higher-level positions, Loshkajian spends less time with donors and more time working with staff, budgets, and planning. "The important part [of my life] is to have worked directly with donors and helped them accomplish something they really wanted to make happen," she said.

**Donald Saposnek, **a lecturer in the Psychology Department, was honored recently by the California Association of Family Court Directors, the political arm of the Administrative Office of the Court/Judicial Council of California. He received an award for "Outstanding Service to Family Courts of California" for his work in the field of child custody over the past 17 years.

Saposnek was also selected recently as one of eight national delegates who will participate in a "Divorce Solution Think Tank." Saposnek, the author of _Mediating Child Custody Disputes,_ will join other social scientists and legal scholars in an attempt to develop new paradigms for making divorce a less destructive process for all involved.
