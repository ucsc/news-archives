title: Biologist Douglas Kellogg Wins Pew Scholarship
author: Tim Stephens

Biologist Douglas Kellogg, an assistant professor of biology, has been named a 1998 Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences by the Pew Charitable Trusts. Kellogg, the first UCSC researcher to win this prestigious award, will receive a total of $200,000 to support his research over a four-year period. He is one of 20 junior faculty members at medical schools and research institutions across the United States recognized this year by the Pew Scholars Program as "America's most promising biomedical researchers."

The Pew scholarships are granted to young investigators who show outstanding promise in the basic and clinical sciences. They are intended to encourage scholarly innovation and to advance the state of knowledge in the biomedical sciences.

Kellogg's research focuses on the factors that control the division of cells, the basic building blocks of plants and animals. Regulation of cell division is of central importance to the normal growth and development of all organisms. Abnormalities in this process play an important role in diseases such as cancer, which results from uncontrolled cell division.

The orderly sequence of events leading up to the division of one cell into two identical daughter cells is called the cell-division cycle. Kellogg is using biochemical and genetic approaches to study the molecular signals that regulate the events in this cycle.

Kellogg received a B.A. in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a Ph.D. in cell biology from the University of California, San Francisco. He joined the faculty of UCSC's Department of Biology in 1995.
