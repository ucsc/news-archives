SANTA CRUZ, CA--Enjoy an afternoon of poetry and classical music in the  Alan Chadwick Garden at the University of California, Santa Cruz, on  Saturday, June 7. The event, "Poetry and Music in the Garden," features  readings by four poets from noon until 2 P.M. It is free and open to the public.

The poets who will read their work are:
* Gary Young--Dubbed "the poet laureate of Bonny Doon" by Good  Times columnist Bruce Bratton, Young has a new book out called Days. His  previous books include My Place Here Below: Fifteen Poems & Dry Points, My  Brother's in Wyoming: Poems and Drawings, and We Are Less Surrounded by  Water on this Island than by Air.
* Lee Perron--Perron lives, writes, and runs a rare book business in  Geyserville. He is the author of Seeking the Hills, Her Majesty the Night, and  The White Bones of the Year are Scattered Among Jonquils.
* Michael Hannon--Discovered by Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Kenneth  Rexroth, Hannon has authored more than 15 poetry books, including Poems & Days and Ordinary Messengers. A master of the short lyric, Hannon is also the  author of "My Mother Walked Out," a four-page chant considered by some to be  one of the best long poems written in contemporary American poetry.
* Anita Wilkins--An instructor at Cabrillo College, Wilkins  specializes in poetry and international literature. She is the author of three  volumes of poetry, including Talking to the Blindman and The Trees Along This  Road. She received the Pushcart Prize for Poetry in 1983.

In addition to poetry and music, free food and beverages will be offered.  For those inspired to garden, organic plants raised at the UCSC Farm and  Garden will be available for purchase.

The main entrance to the Alan Chadwick Garden is located on McLaughlin  Drive across from Stevenson College, where free parking will be available.  The reading is sponsored by the Friends of the UCSC Farm and Garden. For  more information, call (408) 459-3240.
