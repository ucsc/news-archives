author: UCSC Currents

Rev. Jesse Jackson is scheduled to make an appearance on campus on Tuesday, October 21, as part of his "Saving the Dream" tour. He is scheduled to speak at 8 p.m. at Stevenson Dining Hall.

Seating is limited. Admission is $1 for UCSC students with  I.D. cards, $2 for UCSC faculty and staff, and $3 for general  admission. Approximately 475 tickets will go on sale, beginning at 4 p.m. Tuesday at Stevenson College.

Because the number of seats in the dining hall is not expected to accommodate people interested in Jackson's appearance, the  speech will be simulcast at the following locations: 105 Oakes and Classroom 1. It will also be broadcast on the campus cable system (Channel 48).

This event is sponsored by the student organizations A/BSA, APISA, MEChA, and SANAI and Stevenson College.

For more information, call Erica Ocegueda at 302-6673.
