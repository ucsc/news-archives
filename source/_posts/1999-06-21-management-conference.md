The conference, which took place June 6-8 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, drew more than 400 academic leaders, administrative managers, and professional staff from across the UC system.

A reception at the San Jose Museum of Art the first night of the conference featured French caberet music performed by Java Blue.
