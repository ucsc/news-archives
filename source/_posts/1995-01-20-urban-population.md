SANTA CRUZ, CA--Leticia Quezada, the first Latina to serve on the  Los Angeles City Board of Education, says ethnic minorities are still  greatly underrepresented in the UC system, but that will change  with the coming generation of urban students. "The university is not  ready," Quezada warns. "It's going to create a culture shock, both for  the students and for the university."

In a free public lecture titled "Ready Or Not, Here We Come:  Urban and Ethnically Diverse Young People Are Tomorrow's  University Scholars," Quezada will present her views on Friday,  January 27, 4:30-5:30 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2.

"I'm coming from the perspective of the Los Angeles city  schools, where 90 percent of the students are ethnic minorities,"  Quezada says. "Two-thirds of these urban young people are Latino.  We need to talk about what needs and assets they will bring to the  university. It's not that the issues are not known, but I want to put  an accent on this reality."

Quezada's talk will be the second presentation this academic  year in the Chancellor's Distinguished Seminar Series on Mission,  Quality, and Diversity, established last year by UCSC Chancellor Karl  S. Pister and UCSC's Academic Senate. Pister created the seminar  series to encourage campus dialogue on themes that he views as  critical to UCSC's success. The seminars are the public part of a  program in which prominent women and minorities spend a day with  faculty and students to discuss how to improve the quality of higher  education in the United States.

According to Quezada, the first language for 47 percent of the  Los Angeles student population is not English. While most of them  speak Spanish, the remaining 10 percent speak 95 different  languages. "Language means culture," Quezada says. "The university  has to create a bridge to those communities."

Many students from Los Angeles come from segregated,  virtually all-Latino schools. When they come to the university,  especially to UCSC, the students have to adjust, says Quezada. But  nowthe system has to change. "It's much better to prognosticate  changes that must be made--to meet the students half way."

Quezada, who has a master's degree in education and graduated  with honors from UCSC with a B.A. in psychology in 1975, will serve  on the school board through 1995. She also currently sits on the  board of the UCSC Foundation and is a member of the systemwide UC  Latino Eligibility Task Force.

Elected Los Angeles City Board of Education president in 1992- 93, she was reelected by her colleagues to serve for a second term  in 1993-94. The board is responsible for educational policy  decisions that affect 800,000 students enrolled in over 850  elementary, middle, senior high, and adult schools in the largest  school district in the state.

As president, she led the board through the adoption of a  restructuring of the district to permit broad local-school decision  making and increased parent involvement. She successfully fought a  statewide initiative that would have enabled the transfer of public  school funding to private schools as well as a legislative effort to  break up her school district. And she worked to secure funding to  recover from the 6.8 Northridge earthquake that damaged 200  schools.

Quezada has also long been involved in feminist Latina efforts,  having served as national president for Comision Femenil, one of the  oldest Latina feminist activist groups in the country.
