![\[Photo of Chancellor Greenwood, Tom Campbell, and staff\]][1] Chancellor Greenwood joined Republican congressman Tom Campbell (center, back row) and 15 of his staff members for a tour of UCSC's Long Marine Lab late last month. The congressman and his staff were visiting locations in his 15th congressional district on a get-acquainted tour for the staff. UCSC and the laboratory are not within Campbell's district, but the congressman included it in the tour because of his advocacy efforts for education, UC, and the Monterey Bay marine sancturary.
