There may be no such thing as a free lunch, but there is a free breakfast--for anyone who leaves their car at home on Bike to Work/School Day on Thursday, May 20.

UCSC will serve Odwalla juice, local muffins, Beckmann's cinnamon rolls, Cliff Bars, and coffee at the UCSC Student Center from 6:30 to 9:30 a.m. for the 12th annual Bike to Work/School Day. Free mini tune-ups for bicycles will also be offered.

The free breakfast is just a taste of the many events taking place for the newly renamed Bike Week. Also on tap for the week are bicycle rides across the county countryside, bike-maintenance classes, social gatherings, and a human-powered parade. For more information, go to the Bike Week Web site at www.bike2work.com or call (831) 423-3773.
