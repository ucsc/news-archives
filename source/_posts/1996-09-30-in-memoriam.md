**William  Burke,** professor of astronomy and astrophysics and physics, died on July 22 in a Las Vegas hospital from complications following surgery. He had sustained major injuries when his truck overturned in high winds while he was returning from a rafting trip through the Grand Canyon. He was 55.

Burke came to UCSC in 1969 after earning a B.S. and a Ph.D. in physics from Caltech. During his career he was involved in the study of gravity waves and the use of quasars as probes of the universe, and he wrote two textbooks in his field. He will be remembered by his colleagues for his multidisciplinary explorations of scientific issues and his extraordinary physical agility and grace and by his students for his rewarding teaching style, which demanded complete intellectual engagement.  

**Bryan Strong,** a lecturer in psychology at UCSC since 1981, died at his home in Felton on August 10 after a three-year fight with cancer. He was 53. Strong received his B.A. in humanities from Claremont McKenna College and a Ph.D. in history from Stanford University. He wrote college texts on marriage, family, and human sexuality, as well as a two-volume work on the Unix computer system. He was a popular teacher and is remembered by his friends as optimistic and good-natured.  

**Kay O'Brien,** who had worked at McHenry Library for 22 years prior to her retirement in 1990, died at her home in Aptos on August 21 after a long illness.
