title: UC Santa Cruz Professor To Receive "Volunteer Of The Year"  Award From National Bicycling Society

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Kevin Karplus, his last name notwithstanding,  does not drive a car, nor has he ever possessed a driver's license.  This computer scientist has had one modus transporandi for the last  23 years: the bicycle. But you won't see him winning races or tearing  up off-road trails. Rather, Karplus devotes his energy to cycling  from Point A to Point B on streets and bike paths--and to making it  easier and safer for others to do the same.

In fact, Karplus has done so much for cyclists in Santa Cruz  County that the League of American Bicyclists, a national society,  will honor him next week with its "Phyllis W. Harmon Volunteer of  the Year" award. Karplus had planned to bike to a rally in San Diego  to receive the award, but the rally was canceled; instead, the league  will recognize him from a distance during its meeting in Salisbury,  Maryland, July 21-24.

"This is a small reward for years of sitting in boring  government meetings, arguing for better bike facilities, better bike  education, and so forth," says Karplus, an associate professor of  computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz. "More rewarding have been  the various successes along the way."

For instance, local motorists may notice a growing number of  bike lanes on busy streets and bicycle sensors at stoplights--due in  no small part to years of hard work by Karplus and others on the  bicycle committee of the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation  Commission. The Watsonville Police Department presented bicycle- safety information and a bilingual flyer prepared by Karplus to  students in all of Watsonville's public schools. A bike-education  video and curriculum went out to all fourth-grade teachers in the  county, thanks to Karplus and the rest of the Santa Cruz Community  Traffic Safety Coalition. Political activism by People Power, with  Karplus as a former member of the steering committee, led to  positive changes for bicycles in the Vision Santa Cruz plans for  revitalizing downtown. The list goes on. Such efforts always involve  many people; Karplus, it seems, is always one of them.

He is quick to note that cooperative leaders in the area have  fostered many of these changes. "Santa Cruz at the moment has the  most bike-friendly government I've seen," he says. "The City Council  in particular has been very friendly toward bikes, and the latest  general plan has excellent bicycle provisions," such as short-term  parking and bike lockers for commuters. Indeed, Karplus was so  impressed with a new city bike-parking ordinance--passed primarily  because of the efforts of bicycle activist Ron Goodman of People  Power--that he posted the text on the Internet computer network  for cyclists around the world to read.

"Local jurisdictions have been putting a fair percentage of  their federal transportation funds into bike projects," Karplus adds.  "That tells me a lot more about the commitment to making the  infrastructure work for bicyclists than any policy statement."

Despite such progress, Karplus sees a need for better and more  widespread bike education, both for cyclists and drivers. The  Department of Motor Vehicles now shows a video on sharing the road  with bicycles to its driver-education classes, he notes. But to effect  real change, he says, young cyclists need to learn safe and courteous  habits early in life, both for their own protection and to create a  generation of bicycle riders who obey traffic laws.

"There are people who are vehemently opposed to bicyclists,  and there are some bicyclists who do what they can to justify that  image," Karplus says. "Other bicyclists need to get more angry at  those who disobey the rules." Ticketing by police officers is  surprisingly effective, he observes: "People are more afraid of  getting a ticket than of being killed in an accident."

Karplus traces his own interest in cycling to teenage  nonconformity. "Mom really wanted me to drive," he admits. He got a  learner's permit but never a driver's license, deciding that at least  half the people he saw on the road shouldn't be there. Environmental  and financial reasons entered the picture later in life, as did the  exercise factor: "I hate to exercise," he says. "If I didn't ride up to  campus every day, I probably wouldn't get enough."

Karplus has never had a serious bicycling injury, although he  once went flying into a car and shattered its windshield when the  car turned in front of him. Occasionally, he draws stares when he  transports large items in his bicycle trailer, such as a four-drawer  file cabinet and, on one occasion, a low-flow toilet.

Being able to ride to work and around town year-round was a  big draw when Karplus came to UCSC from Cornell University in  1986\. Since then, friends have carried items for him in private  motor vehicles just twice: once when he moved, and again recently  when he bought a new recumbent bicycle in Berkeley and had to get  it back to Santa Cruz. Otherwise, he takes the city bus a few times  each year, occasionally rides in cars "to be sociable," and walks a lot  with his wife. "Friends say that I'll be forced to get a car if we have  a child," he says. "But I'm not even convinced of that."
