UC Santa Cruz students are looking now for their fall housing. If you have a room, apartment, condo, or house available for rent in September, list it now with UCSC's Community Rentals Office. And, it's free. Community Rentals also offers a variety of forms, contracts, and rental information.

To place your listing, call 459-4435 weekdays between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Again, the number to call is 459-4435.
