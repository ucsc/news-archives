**Chancellor Greenwood will speak on the topic of "Issues in Biotechnology"** at the first meeting of the fall of the UCSC Women's Club on Wednesday, September 24, from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at University House. The UCSC Women's Club meets once a month during the academic year and is open to all women in the Santa Cruz community. The club raises money for re-entry women's scholarships and provides an atmosphere of support for women's issues, research, and scholarship. For more information, call University Advancement at (408) 459-2501.

**All university vehicles users now have roadside protection,** as a result of an arrangement with the state General Services. The National Auto Club will respond to a call to an 800 number and provide roadside assistance. Those traveling off campus should stop by the Fleet Services Office for a free window sticker. There is no charge for this coverage; the only charge occurs if the service is used. For more information, e-mail Wes Scott, Fleet Services manager, at wes_scott@macmail.ucsc.edu.
