Shakespeare Santa Cruz was awarded nine _Drama-Logue_ Critics Awards for its 1997 season. The coveted awards, presented each year for the past 21 years by the Hollywood-based weekly theater review and casting magazine _Drama-Logue,_ recognize exceptional theater produced in the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas during the previous year. This year's awards ceremony was held January 19 at the Pasadena Playhouse.

San Francisco Bay Area critic Dean Goodman recognized Shakespeare Santa Cruz's production of _Richard III_ in the following categories: overall production (Artistic Director Paul Whitworth), direction (Michael Edwards), costume design (Tom Broecker), performance (Paul Whitworth in the title role), original music (Robby McLean), scenic design (Kevin Adams), and lighting design (Kevin Adams). Shakespeare Santa Cruz's production of _As You Like It_ was recognized in the following categories: original music (Greg Coffin) and performance (James Newcomb as Touchstone.)

The _Drama-Logue_ awards are based on each individual critic's expression of appreciation for impressive work done. "Stardom is not what _Drama-Logue_ Awards are about," says _Drama-Logue_ theater editor Polly Warfield. "They're about talent, skill, quality, a special something that makes a performer, a production, a design--the work--stand out."

Shakespeare Santa Cruz is a nonprofit theater company dedicated to exploring and shaping the new American voice in the performance of Shakespeare. Last year's festival attracted a record 32,000 patrons.

The 1998 festival season opens July 23 and runs through September 6. It features _Othello,_ _Much Ado About Nothing,_ and _The Marriage of Figaro_ by French playwright Beaumarchais. For more information, call (408) 459-2121.
