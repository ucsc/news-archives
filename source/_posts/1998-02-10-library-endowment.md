SANTA CRUZ, CA--A special collection of funds in support of  acquisitions for the University Library at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, recently reached $1 million in value, thanks to the generosity of  a number of benefactors (see attached list of donors).

Twenty-three endowments have been established by these donors in a  range of subjects from horticulture to Jewish studies to the Pacific Rim.  The endowments are an important means of expanding the library  collection, providing a source of ongoing support for acquisitions in a  specific area of interest.

"The library is here, not just for today's faculty and students, but for  the scholars of tomorrow," said University Librarian Allan Dyson. "Through  the establishment of endowed funds, our farsighted supporters have ensured  that the record of human knowledge will be documented, preserved, and  made accessible as far as we can see into the future."

The names of the library's philanthropists and the 23 endowments they  have established are commemorated on plaques in the entryway to UCSC's  McHenry Library on a "wall of honor." The wall was unveiled at a December  ceremony attended by donors, their families, and friends of the library.

At the dedication ceremony, noted writer and UCSC alumna Lynn  Stegner, chair of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation's Library Development  Committee, commented on the myriad values of the subject endowment in  broadening and enhancing the library's collection. "A book is not just a way  of containing information. A book is the thing itself--it has weight and  scent and it engages the imagination and the memory. For those reasons it  is intrinsically human. If we can't save that part of ourselves as a species  then we're in deep trouble."

The names of the endowments are listed below. For more information  on establishing an endowment, contact Library Development Officer  Margaret Gordon at (408) 459-4211 or mgordon@cats.ucsc.edu.
