SANTA CRUZ, CA--The purchase of a clubhouse some 40 years ago by  members of a Santa Cruz women's organization will benefit  tomorrow's female leaders through a gift that the club has made to a  University of California, Santa Cruz, scholarship program.

At a luncheon held on campus March 30, the Santa Cruz  Business and Professional Women's Club presented UCSC Chancellor  Karl S. Pister with a $200,000 check to endow an annual Leadership  Opportunity Awards (LOA) scholarship in the club's name. The gift  will enable UCSC to provide $10,000 each year to a student selected  to receive a LOA scholarship. Club members specified that their gift  support a female student.

"The Santa Cruz Business and Professional Women's Club's  generous gift is more than an investment in this scholarship  program," Pister said. "It is an investment in the students the  program supports--the people who will serve as tomorrow's  leaders--and in the future of our state."

The work that produced the $200,000 scholarship actually  began in the 1950s, when Santa Cruz Business and Professional  Women's Club members raised money to buy a clubhouse on Plymouth  Street in Santa Cruz, said UCSC Extension Dean Janice Corriden,  president of the club. The group is the local chapter of the  international Business and Professional Women's (BPW) organization.

The current membership decided they no longer needed a  private clubhouse, Corriden said, and believed that the proceeds  from its sale could benefit one of the organization's favorite causes:  education.

"BPW has long been interested in helping to create women  leaders," Corriden said, "and we have always believed that education  is the key to success for women in our society." For a number of  years, the local chapter has given smaller scholarships to students  attending UCSC, as well as to students at Cabrillo College in Santa  Cruz County.

The sale of the clubhouse, to the Scandinavian Cultural Center  of Santa Cruz County, was finalized recently, enabling the women's  club to increase its support of higher education.

UCSC's Leadership Opportunity Awards program, with its  emphasis on creating future leaders, honoring achievement, and  assisting students in financial need, is a "perfect match with the  ideals of the club," Corriden said.

The LOA program was established in 1993 by Chancellor Pister  to recognize talented students who have overcome adverse  socioeconomic circumstances, have demonstrated a commitment to  assisting and improving the lives of others, and who might not  otherwise be able to attend UCSC for financial reasons. Several  students are nominated annually by the presidents of each of  thirteen community colleges in the region, and recipients are  selected by Chancellor Pister in consultation with the Leadership  Opportunity Awards Advisory Committee.

Those selected receive $10,000 scholarships for each of two  years, enabling them to complete their undergraduate education at  UCSC. In addition, they receive assistance finding paid summer work  experience in a field that complements their academic studies and  the support of a strong academic mentoring program.

Since its start, LOA has funded scholarships for 22 students.  To date, UCSC has raised nearly $3.2 million of the $5 million  endowment needed to fund the program permanently.
