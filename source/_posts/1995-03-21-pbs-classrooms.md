SANTA CRUZ, CA--To complement upcoming presentations of Charles  Dickens's Martin Chuzzlewit (April 2-23, locally) and Hard Times  (April 30), airing as part of Mobil Masterpiece Theatre on PBS, a  resource kit and viewers' guide have been produced for use by  educators and the general public.

The materials were coproduced by the Dickens Project at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, and the British Broadcasting  Corporation's (BBC's) Education Directorate. The viewer's guide,  suitable for the general public, is titled What the Dickens: A Guide to  Martin Chuzzlewit and Hard Times. The 36-page booklet offers a  brief introduction to Dickens's life, the two novels, and their  adaptation for television.

The resource kit consists of a videocassette, an audiocassette,  and two illustrated workbooks, designed to enhance reading of the  novels and classroom viewings of the PBS dramatizations. The  videocassette supplies accessible and lively background on both the  novels and Victorian life, employing footage from the BBC's vast  archive and interviews with internationally renowned Dickens  scholars. The audiocassette will spark children's imaginations with  the sounds of Victorian times--circuses, trains, passing carriages,  and more. A classroom workbook, Doorway to Dickens, offers  activities, teaching assignments, quotations, and illustrations to be  used in conjunction with the video- and audiocassettes. A teacher's  resource guide provides further background on Dickens and his time  through specially commissioned essays and classic studies of Martin  Chuzzlewit and Hard Times.

The Dickens Project, founded in 1981, is an international  consortium of faculty and graduate students headquartered at UC  Santa Cruz. The home of an extensive library and archive on Dickens,  the project promotes collaborative research and produces curricular  materials for use in teaching Dickens.

Martin Chuzzlewit is coproduced by BBC's Pebble Mill and WGBH  Boston; Hard Times is coproduced by BBC School Programmes--a  division of BBC Education--and WGBH Boston.
