SANTA CRUZ, CA--Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, attracted $53.4 million in external contracts and grants to UCSC last year, the highest total ever received by the campus.

The increase in contracts and grants funding during the 1999-2000 year reflects a pattern of continued growth that the campus has sustained for the last decade. The campus's total contracts and grants funding has grown by more than 150 percent since 1990.

The single-largest grant, for $4.3 million, was received by the Center for Adaptive Optics, one of five Science and Technology Centers approved for funding by the National Science Foundation in 1999.** **Research funds received from federal, state, and private agencies totaled $53,405,919 between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000. That figure is 5.6 percent higher than the previous year's total of $50.6 million.

"We continue to do well, and UCSC's grant and contracts awards have grown over the last five years at the fastest rate of any UC campus," said William Clark, director of UCSC's Office of Sponsored Projects.

The campus processed a total of 628 awards in 1999-2000, compared to 635 in 1998-99. Principal funders included the National Science Foundation ($13.9 million), the National Institutes of Health ($7.6 million), the U.S. Department of Education ($5.6 million), the U.S. Department of Energy ($2.9 million), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ($2.3 million).

Eight different departments or research groups at UCSC brought in more than $2 million each in contracts and grants funding. They are biology ($6.3 million), Institute of Marine Sciences ($5.7 million), education ($5.4 million), chemistry ($5.4 million), MBEST ($3.3 million), Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics ($2.8 million), computer engineering ($2.0 million), and Institute of Tectonics ($2.0 million).

The largest awards were received for research in the areas of adaptive optics, cultural diversity and second-language learning, cancer research, development of the Fort Ord/MBEST project, particle physics, and computer networking.
