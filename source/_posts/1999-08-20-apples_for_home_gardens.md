## Learn About Apples For Home Gardeners At UCSC Workshop September 11

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Whether you like them tart and crunchy or thin- skinned and sweet, apples will be the subject of a free two-hour workshop on Saturday, September 11, from 10 a.m. until noon at the Alan Chadwick Garden at UC Santa Cruz.

Apple tree aficionado Orin Martin, manager of the Chadwick Garden, will share his infectious enthusiasm for this tasty crop. Martin will focus on providing an overview of the major parent lines of the modern apples we know and love.

"The vast majority of apples come from five classes, or parent lines: Golden Delicious, Macintosh, Cox's Orange Pippin, Russets, and pippin types," said Martin. "We'll trace all of the popular new apples, like Galas, Fujis, and Braeburns, and we'll talk about a lot of the lesser-known but equally wonderful apples."

Elstar is one of Martin's favorites. Slightly more tart and aromatic than the Gala apple, with a complex taste, Elstar is the leading dessert apple of Northern Europe. But you won't find it at your local market. "If we were in Brussels or the Netherlands, it would be everywhere, but it hasn't caught on here," said Martin, adding that he thinks it is "far superior to Gala, which is itself a great apple."

Similarly, the flesh of russeted apples is some of the "sweetest in the world, with a full, almost nutty flavor," said Martin. But Russets have a rough, textured skin that has made them one of the most underappreciated apples. "You'll never find them at the store because they're not pretty," notes Martin.

By learning about the parentage of apples, the class will help gardeners explore unusual varieties, both old and new.

"People know what they like, but they don't know how to break it apart and analyze it," said Martin. "This will help them figure out varieties they're less familiar with, so they'll know what they might like to eat, plant, and buy."
