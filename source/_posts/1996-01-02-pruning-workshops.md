SANTA CRUZ, CA--If pruning your fruit trees gives you an annual  case of the jitters, help is available. Orin Martin, manager of the  Alan Chadwick Garden at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is  offering two-day workshops for beginning and intermediate home  orchardists.

The workshops will cover everything you need to know to prune  and care for trees with confidence, from choosing rootstock to  pruning and harvesting. With an emphasis on apples and pears, Martin  will discuss the different varieties available and different  suppliers, and he'll cover ground preparation, planting, training,  fertility, and basic fruit tree care throughout the year.

"Following the seasonal cycle of the tree--dormancy, pruning,  bloom, fruit set through harvest--participants will leave the  workshop with a care calendar for tending their trees," says Martin.

Martin is offering two workshops at a cost of $65 each for  Friends of the Farm and Garden, and $75 for nonmembers. The first  workshop will be held Friday and Saturday, January 19 and 20. The  workshop kicks off Friday from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. with a slide show,  lecture, and question-and-answer period in the Horticulture Building  at the UCSC Arboretum. On Saturday, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.,  participants will watch planting, pruning, and training  demonstrations and then will have an opportunity to practice on  trees in the Chadwick Garden.

The second workshop will be offered Friday and Saturday,  February 2 and 3, with the same hours and format.

Enrollment is limited to 15 students per workshop, and  advance registration is required. The registration deadline for the  first workshop is January 12, and the deadline for the second  workshop is January 26.

To register, or for more information, call (408) 459-3240 or  (408) 459-3376.
