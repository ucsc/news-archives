**Viktor Ginzburg**

Assistant Professor of Mathematics  

Viktor Ginzburg's broad research interests are in classical global analysis. He studies mathematical models of physical processes that display symmetries, periodic motions, or initial conditions that might lead to periodic motions, such as the orbits of celestial bodies or the motions of charges in a magnetic field. Ginzburg earned his M.S. in applied mathematics from the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys and his Ph.D. in mathematics from UC Berkeley. He held positions at Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and at Stanford.
