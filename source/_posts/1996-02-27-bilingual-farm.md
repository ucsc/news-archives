SANTA CRUZ, CA--Come celebrate the beginning of spring with a  visit to the lush organic Farm or the historic Alan Chadwick Garden  at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Beginning March 21, Farm  tours will be held every Thursday at noon and most Sundays at 2 p.m.  For the first time this year, tours of the Chadwick Garden will be  held on the first Sunday of each month at 2 p.m. There will be no  Farm tour that day.

Also new this year are bilingual tours of the Farm; on the third  Sunday of the month, the tour will be conducted in English and  Spanish. Trained docents offer the free 90-minute public tours.

All tours highlight the ecologically sound farming methods  used at UC Santa Cruz. Visitors to the Farm and its adjoining garden  will see row crops, orchards, and the biointensive garden where  flowers, vegetables, and herbs are grown without chemical  pesticides or fertilizers. University researchers are constantly  developing new organic growing techniques on the Farm, where field  tests are under way year-round. Docents provide an overview of  UCSC's research in sustainable agriculture as part of the tour, and  many of the techniques used at the Farm are appropriate for  backyard gardeners. Spring activities include soil preparation,  cultivation and planting of seedlings, as well as the harvest of early  spring vegetables.

At the Chadwick Garden, visitors will see an impressive  display of organic roses, native perennials, dwarf fruit trees, and an  array of fruits and vegetables that are cultivated on a steep slope.

Farm tours begin at the Farm entrance, which is located 1/4  mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; parking is  available across the street from the Blacksmith Shop in the Campus  Facilities parking lot. Tours of the Chadwick Garden meet at the  garden entrance on Coolidge Drive; parking is available in the  Stevenson College parking lots across the street.

Special tours are also available for schoolchildren and other  groups. For more information, call Melanie Mintz at (408) 459-3248.
