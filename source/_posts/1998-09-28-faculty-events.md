title: Dinner, Barbecue Help Launch The New Academic Year
author: UCSC Currents
---

A new year is under way, and what better way to celebrate than with food and conversation. With that idea in mind, two events will welcome faculty and staff into the academic year.

**For faculty: **A buffet-style "strolling dinner" on Wednesday, October 28, from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. Location to be announced.
**For staff: **The annual Staff Barbecue at the East Field on Monday, October 12, from 11:30 to 1:30 p.m. The barbecue features a variety of picnic foods including burgers, veggie burgers, salads, lemonade, and dessert. The OPERS pool, lockers, and towels will be available for participants to use at no charge during the event.

Staff will be provided release time to participate in the barbecue, but campus offices normally open during the noon hour should remain open.

People who wish to attend the barbecue are requested to RSVP no later than Thursday, October 8, to Jeff Rockwell via e-mail ([jrock@cats][2]).

Staff are strongly advised to ride the campus shuttles to the barbecue. Construction taking place on campus is expected to limit the parking available in the East Field lot.
