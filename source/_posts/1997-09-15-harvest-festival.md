SANTA CRUZ, CA--Put on your dancing shoes, grab the kids, and head for the  UC Santa Cruz Farm on Saturday, October 4, where the fourth annual Harvest  Festival will get under way at 11 A.M. This year's festival coincides with the  30th anniversary of the UCSC Farm & Garden, and organizers have pulled out  all the stops to guarantee a spectacular day of fun, live music, and tasty  food.

Headlining this year's celebration of the harvest is Santa Cruz's own  Banana Slug String Band. This popular group delights both adults and children  with its unique blend of original music and environmental education. The  band's one-hour performance begins at 11:30 A.M. and will be followed by Mr.  Hedge on the musical saw and the Cajun dance tunes of Jr. Buclieu and the I- 10s.

Activities for children will include hayrides, potato printing, face and  pumpkin painting, cornhusk dollmaking, and games of Find-the-Peanut-in- the-Haystack. Gardeners are encouraged to pick up tips from the experts at  several workshops, and a winter squash tasting will take the mystery out of  lesser-known varieties like delicata, red curry, and sweet dumpling. Docent- led tours of the Farm will depart at noon, 2 P.M., and 4 P.M. In addition,  community groups will have informational displays, Farm merchandise and  organic produce will be available for purchase, and door prizes will be  presented throughout the day.

Admission to the festival is $5; admission is free for children under  12 and members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden, which is  sponsoring the event.

The Farm is located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith  Shop; free public parking is available across the street from the Blacksmith  Shop in the Physical Plant parking lot.
