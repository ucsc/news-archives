SANTA CRUZ, CA--Karen Holl, an assistant professor of environmental  studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has received a  prestigious Lindbergh Grant from the Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh  Foundation to continue her work on tropical reforestation.

The grant for $9,935 will support Holl's research on the restoration of  tropical rain forests in Latin America, where forests are being cleared for  agriculture and then frequently abandoned after five to 10 years due to  declining productivity or changes in global food markets.

Only 10 Lindbergh Grants are presented annually, and the maximum  amount of $10,580 represents the cost of the Spirit of St. Louis airplane in  1927\. Holl's proposal was one of nearly 400 submitted. Applicants from a  wide spectrum of disciplines are rewarded for work that offers significant  potential to further a better balance between technology and the natural  environment.

Although nearly half of the tropical moist forest worldwide has been  destroyed and approximately 2 percent of the remaining forests are being  destroyed each year, information on tropical forest recovery is extremely  limited.

Restoration is problematic because the disturbed land lacks species  native to the original forest, and agricultural operations have often  introduced erosion and nutrient problems, displaced native seeds, compacted  the soil, and reduced soil fertility. Stressful climatic conditions and  competition with aggressive, non-native pasture grasses add additional  challenges.

"Developing techniques to restore these ecosystems constitutes a  formidable challenge, but restoration is an essential part of ensuring the  future well-being of the rapidly increasing human population," said Holl, who  has spent the past three years investigating factors that limit recovery and  exploring strategies to facilitate restoration of tropical forests.

The Lindbergh Grant will fund experiments that involve the planting of  shrub species to facilitate ecosystem recovery and native tree seedlings  that will generate valuable timber resources. The grant funds her work for a  14-month period that ends September 1, 1998. This research has been  previously funded by the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of  Energy's Global Change Program, and the American Philosophical Society.

The Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh Foundation was created in  1977 to mark the 50th anniversary of Charles Lindbergh's epic New York-to- Paris flight. The effort to establish the national nonprofit organization was  led by General James H. Doolittle and Astronaut Neil Armstrong.
