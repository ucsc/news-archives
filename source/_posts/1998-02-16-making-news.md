History professor **Pedro Castillo** was quoted in the Mexican newspapers--_Diario de Chihuahua_ and _El Heraldo de Chihuahua_ in Chihuahua and _El Universal_ and _La Cronica_ in Mexicali--after he presented a series of talks on Mexican immigration, the Mexican American community, and the Latino vote this past December. He was also quoted in _El Norte_ and _El Diario_ in Monterrey and _Ocho Columnas_ and _Publico in Guadalajara_ after a series of lectures on the same topics in January.

Psychology's **Elliot Aronson** recently gave a long telephone interview to Maggie Scarf of the _New Republic_ magazine, who was writing about the public's reaction to the latest White House sex scandal. A lot of people are in a state of cognitive dissonance, wanting Clinton to stay in office because they think he is doing a great job while also thinking that, if he did lie and encourage others to lie under oath, he should be removed from office, explained Aronson. The polls reflect the ambivalence, said Aronson, whose analysis was at the heart of Scarf's column.

_Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ sports writer Dan Fitch wrote a lengthy piece about **Slug Sports,** which are poised now to overcome the barriers of apathy and lack of funding and to be taken seriously, thanks, in part, to a pledge by Chancellor Greenwood "to put university dollars where its athletics are."

In celebration of Valentine's Day, **Laura Helmuth** from the Science Writing Program interviewed biologist **Maggie Fusari** and environmental studies museum curator **Jeff Davis** for a KUSP _Field Notes_ piece about the mating behaviors of local animals. Davis talked about some mating rituals local waterfowl partake in over the winter, and Fusari talked about salamander mating rituals. . . . Also, in an interview with the _Salinas Californian,_ Fusari gave a positive spin to this winter's deluge: She predicts Pacific tree frogs and the endangered red-legged frog will breed merrily in all the ponds and puddles.
