**Recently Endowed Chair In Psychology Supports Rogoff's Study Of  Intellectual Development**

SANTA CRUZ, CA---Everyone has concerns about schools today--from  parents and teachers to business and civic leaders. At a time when  creative solutions appear to be in short supply, some answers may  be found in the work of Barbara Rogoff, UCSC Foundation Professor  of Psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Rogoff's work as a developmental psychologist has value for  educators grappling with common classroom problems. Rogoff has  spent more than twenty years exploring how children learn, with an  emphasis on the cross-cultural intellectual growth of children. Her  work in recent years has focused on an innovative elementary school  in Salt Lake City that takes a unique approach to stimulating the  interests of children.

Rogoff, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1992, was appointed  last summer to the newly created UC Santa Cruz Foundation Chair in  Psychology. Rogoff believes that children must be studied in their  own environments, and the endowed chair will support her research- -in children's homes, in their schools, and with family and friends.

"Psychology typically focuses on children's development as if  they were developing in a test tube separate from the real world,"  says Rogoff, who once used the Girl Scout cookie sale as a backdrop  to understand how children plan complicated activities that involve  other people and real consequences.

Rogoff says the girls she studied in that project were  motivated to be efficient and effective, and they had to improvise  when circumstances forced them to change their plans--unlike in an  imaginary planning activity in a laboratory. "Children learn how to be  flexible, and they take advantage of opportunities that come up," she  says. "If children are invested in what they're doing, they're highly  motivated. They'll develop a plan instead of halfheartedly carrying  out someone else's."

Since 1992, Rogoff has studied the school in Salt Lake City.  The public school is built on collaboration--among students,  teachers, parents, and administrators. Parents are required to spend  three hours a week per child at the school, and children are  intimately involved with curriculum development. Unlike traditional  U.S. schools, says Rogoff, teachers do not rely on the lecture format  in the classroom, and students are motivated by learning rather than  by grades and threats.

For example, students choose monthly themes around which the  teachers and parents develop lesson plans. One challenging theme  chosen by first- and second-graders was pizza, recalls Rogoff. But  parents, teachers, and students got to work, and it was a very  successful theme: Pizza turned out to be a great way to teach  fractions, the students had a good time reading books about food and  learning about Italy and immigration, and for economics, the class  went on a field trip to a pizza parlor and heard from the owner about  how he plans his purchases and runs his business. "Of course, pizza  art was easy!" says Rogoff. Best of all, the kids were interested and  motivated to learn.

Rogoff, who came to UCSC from the University of Utah,  initially became involved with the school when her own children  enrolled, but she says the experience transformed her way of  thinking about cognitive development--and education. Rogoff's  research and theoretical ideas reflect what she learned in the school  and illuminate approaches that other educators could take as they  struggle to improve the school performance of children.

"In the U.S., we tend to think that learning depends entirely on  teaching, but learning requires the active involvement of the  learner," says Rogoff. "Learning happens as people participate  together in activities they're interested in. At this school, teachers  support the learning, but they're not the directors of learning."

This collaborative style of learning appears to address the  desires of many advocates of school reform. "One of the goals of the  school (in Salt Lake City) is for children to learn responsibility,"  says Rogoff. "Only by having choices can kids be responsible. If  children help choose their projects, they don't need force or prizes.  The project itself is interesting to them."

The school has expanded on traditional "reports" by holding  "share fairs" during which students spend about fifteen minutes  presenting information they've learned while researching reports  with the whole class. The fairs provide additional motivation for the  children, who know that the judgment of more than the teacher is at  stake, and the rigor of the verbal presentation ensures that the  children have understood the material, notes Rogoff.

Another major inspiration for this approach is cross-cultural  studies that reveal valuable differences in the ways in which  children are encouraged to learn. In one such study, Rogoff looked at  how toddlers and families solve everyday problems together,  comparing families in a Guatemalan town with a middle-class  community in the United States and two other communities. The  technique was simple: During an interview about childrearing, she  presented a parent and child with unfamiliar objects and then  observed as the parent helped the toddler explore the object.

The result? In the middle-class U.S. families, parents typically  assumed responsibility for managing their youngsters. In the Mayan  families, children were more responsible for their own learning;  they had more support but less imposed instruction from adults. In  addition, the middle-class parents relied far more on one-on-one  verbal exchanges with their children that interrupted the interview  than did the Mayan parents, who were able to pay attention to  several events simultaneously and who used more nonverbal  communication--in conjunction with verbal communication--with  their children.

"In the Mayan town, it is assumed that children want to learn,  and that's apparent even at the age of 12 to 24 months," says Rogoff.  "In the middle-class families, many adults seemed to feel they have  to control their kids."

Cross-cultural studies help us notice how we do things, which  is important for both scholars and parents, says Rogoff. "We can all  benefit from ideas we borrow from others and adapt in our own ways  to help ourselves and our children meet the challenges that surround  them," she says.

The key to school reform, according to Rogoff, is to emphasize  collaboration among students, teachers, and parents. Instead of the  old-fashioned "top-down" approach that involves teachers imparting  information through lectures, educators can build on children's  interests, involve parents as active participants, and continue to  learn themselves.
