UC Santa Cruz Honors Program Recognized In White House Ceremony

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Academic Excellence (ACE) Honors Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was among 15 organizations and individuals honored by the White House today for their efforts to encourage minorities, women, and persons with disabilities to earn degrees in science, mathematics, and engineering.

Nancy Cox-Konopelski, director of the ACE Honors Program, accepted the 1999 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring in a ceremony at the White House. The annual award, administered and funded by the National Science Foundation, includes a $10,000 grant and a Presidential commemorative certificate.

UCSC's Division of Natural Sciences established the ACE program in 1986 to help students succeed in entry-level undergraduate science courses. The program focuses on attracting, retaining, and advancing underrepresented undergraduate students who are pursuing math- and science-related careers at UCSC. Through a combination of collaborative problem-solving sessions and one-on-one peer mentoring, ACE provides a setting in which students master the course material while developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Over the past 12 years, the ACE program has helped approximately 2,000 students succeed in introductory-level courses in biology, calculus, chemistry, and physics. ACE students earn about 5 percent more A and B grades in their courses than students at large do. Their graduation rates and participation in undergraduate research are also higher than average.
