KZSC (88.1 FM) announces the kick-off of its fall pledge drive on November 6.

The drive, which is also a celebration of the station's 25th anniversary, has a fund-raising goal of $25,000. Funds will be used to support such improvements as the replacement of an aging transmitter, broadcast equipment upgrades, and boosting the station signal.

KZSC presents broad programming that includes a range of music and public affairs shows. Most importantly, KZSC serves as a training ground for tomorrow's broadcasters, giving students "hands-on" opportunities to broadcast in public radio.

To make a pledge, call (831) 459-2811 or 459-4734.
