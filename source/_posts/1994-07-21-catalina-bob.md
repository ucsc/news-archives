SANTA CRUZ, CA--"Catalina Bob," the resilient common dolphin that  first came ashore in early April, is one step closer to returning to  his ocean home today after a nine-hour transport from the Long  Marine Laboratory at UC Santa Cruz to Sea World in San Diego.

Catalina Bob arrived at Sea World at about 6 a.m. today. His  was immediately placed into a behind-the-scenes pool with another  common dolphin that Sea World is nursing back to health.

"Bob did extremely well on the transport," said Dr. David  Casper, the Long Marine Lab veterinarian who accompanied the  dolphin on the trip. Casper said the dolphin ate a full meal this  morning and appears to be acclimating to his new surroundings and  the other dolphin. The goal is to release both dolphins into a pod of  other common dolphins off the southern California coast.

Dr. Laurie Gage of Marine World Africa USA joined Casper on  the transport, along with two dolphin trainers, one from Marine  World and one from Long Marine Lab. Marine World supplied the truck,  which left Long Marine Lab at about 9 p.m. Wednesday.

Catalina Bob stranded himself near Morro Bay on April 3. A  team led by Gage rehabilitated the dolphin at Marine World in  Vallejo, in conjunction with The Marine Mammal Center of Sausalito.  The caretakers released the dolphin into Monterey Bay on May 9, but  he returned to shore in Santa Cruz two days later and was taken to  Long Marine Lab. From May 11 through July 20, Casper and his  coworkers focused on fighting the dolphin's infections with  antibiotics and increasing his weight. As of his transport, the  dolphin's blood values were close to normal, and he weighed 250  pounds, up from a low of 200 pounds.

Catalina Bob is an adult male common dolphin (Delphinus  capensis), 7-1/2 feet long and perhaps 10 to 12 years old. His care  at Long Marine Lab cost about $2,500 per month and was offset by  contributions of $2,500 from both Marine World Africa USA and The  Marine Mammal Center.
